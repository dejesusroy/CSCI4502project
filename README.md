## Project:  
Mining Reddit Comments

## Project Description:
This project is the result of application of data mining techniques to the January 2017 posts in the r/politics and related subreddits.  We obtained this data from a large JSON dataset of the entire body of posts on Reddit from January 2017. After an exploration of the data in the r/politics subreddit, analyses could conclusively identify the most influential users, posting trends, and common topics of discussion.  This project also offers some analyses via text mining of the actual comment bodies, and identifies some correlation between specific users, the topics they discussed the most, and their possible opinions and political leanings. 


## Questions Sought:
We searched for meaningful patterns in this dataset in an attempt to address and answer some of the following questions:
(1)What were the most commonly used words and phrases used in this subreddit in January 2017?  What does that say about user sentiment and social trends as a whole?
(2)Who are the most influential users in this subreddit, or equivalently, who posts the most frequently in this subreddit?  Where else do they exercise thier influence?  Can we gain any other interesting information about these users from this data set?
(3)When were Reddit users most active on the website in January?  What outside factors could have influenced this behavior?
(4)How do users feel about certain political topics?

## Applications of Knowledge:
Reddit is a huge source of unregulated news and circulated user content.  Extracting meaningful information about this data and Reddit's users could provide insight into social trends and population sentiments that aren't published on mainstream websites of social networks.
