"null","1483771408","False","dc3znem","t1_dc3or5x","These people really are just not really dumb, but they've convinced themselves they have an inside track to the real truth, and that truth is more powerful than any amount of empirical data.  One thing I've noticed about the more hardcore Trumpers is that they're **insanely confident** that they're right, but very rarely will you see them engage in a fact based argument.   I actually had a friendly discussion with one of these very confident Trump supporters, I managed to lure him away from the 'Hillary is the devil rhetoric and get him to engage on economics by convincing him I was a republican that hated Clinton too.  As the discussion evolved I noticed the guy didn't actually know anything about economics, like even on a basic level. I kept asking questions, but the questions I asked would lead him to a conclusion that conflicted with Trump's agenda.  When he claimed NAFTA killed tons of jobs, I'd link a bunch of studies refuting that and then ask him what he thought of them.  When he told me NAFTA wasn't fair and Trump was going to fix it, I asked him if he could copy paste the reasons why NAFTA wasn't fair, which parts of the trade deal should be changed and that's when I realized these people aren't evil, or even dumb, they're just heavily misinformed.  He literally could not answer that question, he just said Trump tweets about it all of the time.  This wasn't  malice, he really thought Trump was the right choice, that NAFTA was bad, Trump was going to fix it so all the low-end manufacturing jobs come back. He wasn't confident because he understood the facts, he was confident because he believed what Trump said, and it made him feel good, so he never applied more scrutiny to it.  And I was reminded of a few pages from Sagan's book the demon haunted world.    >> I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time - when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.  >> The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number one video cassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. Beavis and Butthead remains popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning - not just of science, but of anything - are avoidable, even undesirable. We've arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements - transportation, communications, and all other indus-tries; agriculture, medicine, education, entertainment, protecting the environment; and even the key democratic institution of voting - profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.  >> Avoidable human misery is more often caused not so much by stupidity as by ignorance, particularly our ignorance about ourselves. I worry that, especially as the millen-nium edges nearer, pseudoscience and superstition will seem year by year more tempting, the siren song of unreason more sonorous and attractive.  >> Where have we heard it before? Whenever our ethnic or national prejudices are aroused, in times of scarcity, during challenges to national self-esteem or nerve, when we agonize about our diminished cosmic place and purpose, or when fanaticism is bubbling up around us - then, habits of thought familiar from ages past reach for the controls. The candle flame gutters. Its little pool of light trembles. Darkness gathers.    >> Most of these figures are only after your money. That's the good news. But what worries me is that a Carlos will come along with bigger fish to fry - attractive, commanding, patriotic, exuding leadership. All of us long for a competent, uncorrupt, charismatic leader.  >> We will leap at the opportunity to support, to believe, to feel good. Most reporters, editors and producers, swept up with the rest of us, will shy away from real sceptical scrutiny. He won't be selling you prayers or crystals or tears. Perhaps he'll be selling you a war, or a scapegoat, or a much more all-encompassing bundle of beliefs than Carlos's.   And slowly, as this guy started to realize the facts conflict with what he had been told, he started retreating back into the 'Hillary was the devil, she needed to be stopped because that was all he had left, and I was reminded of another Sagan quote from that very same book.  >> “One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken.

A) We can cover birth control, so we have less children being born to people that shouldn't be having children, people that can't take care of them.

In contrast, as many as 50,000 jobs were “offshored” last year, a decline from about 150,000 in 2003.  >> Why is this significant? 2014’s net increase of at least 10,000 jobs was the first net gain in at least 20 years, Harry Moser, the Reshoring Initiative’s founder and president, told MarketWatch. “The trend in manufacturing in the U.S. is to source domestically,” Moser said. “With 3 [million] to 4 million manufacturing jobs still offshore, we see huge potential for even more growth.”  >> One big catalyst behind the trend: Escalating wages in traditionally lower-cost countries, including China, have pushed companies to reconsider sourcing strategies.  >> To meet consumer demand, companies increasingly want to make products closer to where their customers are and react to trends and ship faster. Additionally, there are shipping costs and import duties to contend with when a company manufactures the products that it intends to sell into the U.S. market overseas. Meanwhile, such variables as environmental issues, product-quality scandals, and incidents like the 2013 Bangladesh garment-factory collapse or this year’s West Coast port slowdown have made domestic production more appealing. Government incentives and a relatively skilled U.S. workforce are also among top factors.  >> In fact, among the world’s top 10 export economies, the U.S. last year ranked No. 2 — behind only China — for cost competitiveness, according to the Boston Consulting Group, with real estate and natural gas and other energy prices tending to apply downward cost pressure in the U.S.  >> CEO Jeff Immelt of GE has said the U.S., on a relative basis, has never been more competitive. For instance, he’s said it takes three hours or less to make a refrigerator, so the total cost can be lower to have it made domestically versus in China or Mexico when factoring in other costs including transportation.

As for this article, it's a textbook example of piss poor reasoning.  >> First, it’s important to have someone who isn’t financially biased shaping education. As a highly successful businesswoman, DeVos doesn’t need the job now, nor will she be looking for an education job later. Her key qualification is that she cares deeply about our children and will do everything in her power to offer them a brighter future. She founded two of the nation’s leading education reform organizations and helped open the door to charter schools in her home state of Michigan. I have known her for many years; she is smart, dynamic, no nonsense and committed. That’s why the education establishment is so animated to stop her.  Right here, this makes no sense. What he's basically saying is that because she's wealthy, she is more qualified to talk about education, he also seems to think a wealthy person can't have a bias, or ideological agenda.   So right off the bat, we've got a serious fallacy.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_crumenam  I can actually prove my point, too.  http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2016/11/23/secretary-of-education-pick-betsy-devos-may-be-a-disaster-for-churchstate-separation/  >> Growing up in the strict Calvinist Christian Reformed Church, Betsy DeVos’ antipathy toward public education may run in her blood. She comes from a politically active, socially conservative family. Her parents are Elsa Prince Broekhuizen and the late Edgar Prince, a Michigan couple that has funded the Religious Right for years.  >> The Princes have provided huge sums to both Focus on the Family and its quasi-affiliate, the Family Research Council (FRC). Even today, the FRC maintains a fulfillment center in Grand Rapids, where the Princes and the DeVoses are based. (Betsy DeVos’ brother, Erik, is notorious in his own right: He founded the controversial international security company Blackwater.)  >> Her husband Dick DeVos, a former candidate for governor of Michigan and heir to the Amway fortune, has also backed Intelligent Design, the widely debunked pseudo-scientific theory that says some Higher Power must have created us (or at least parts of us) because evolution can’t possibly explain it. In 2006, when running for office, Dick DeVos said he wanted to see ID taught alongside evolution in science classes:  >> “I would like to see the ideas of intelligent design — that many scientists are now suggesting is a very viable alternative theory — that that theory and others that would be considered credible would expose our students to more ideas, not less.   http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/opinion/betsy-devos-and-gods-plan-for-schools.html  >> Ms. DeVos is a chip off the old block. At a 2001 gathering of conservative Christian philanthropists, she singled out education reform as a way to “advance God’s kingdom.” In an interview, she and her husband, Richard DeVos Jr., said that school choice would lead to “greater kingdom gain.”  >> And so the family tradition continues, funding the religious right through a network of family foundations — among others, the couple’s own, as well as the Edgar and Elsa Prince Foundation, on whose board Ms. DeVos has served along with her brother, Erik Prince, founder of the military contractor Blackwater. According to Conservative Transparency, a liberal watchdog that tracks donor funding through tax filings, these organizations have funded conservative groups including: the Alliance Defending Freedom, the legal juggernaut of the religious right; the Colorado-based Christian ministry Focus on the Family; and the Mackinac Center for Public Policy.   So his very opening statement was just dismantled by me in the opening, should we keep going?  So basically what you and Mitt Romney are saying is a conservative that is heir to a pyramid scheme fortune, that wants to advanced god's kingdom by pushing charter schools which can use loop holes to teach creationism is a good idea.

To evaluate these arguments, we analyze recent trade data and survey post-NAFTA studies. We find that both the U.S. and Mexico benefit from NAFTA, with much larger relative benefits for Mexico. NAFTA also has had little effect on the U.S. labor market. These results confirm the consensus opinion of economists at the time of the debate. Finally, studies find that trade creation greatly exceeds trade diversion in the region under NAFTA, especially in intermediate goods.   Or:  http://www.nber.org/papers/w18508  >> We build into a Ricardian model sectoral linkages, trade in intermediate goods, and sectoral heterogeneity in production to quantify the trade and welfare effects from tariff changes. We also propose a new method to estimate sectoral trade elasticities consistent with any trade model that delivers a multiplicative gravity equation. We apply our model and use our estimated elasticities to identify the impact of NAFTA's tariff reductions. We find that Mexico's welfare increases by 1.31%, U.S.'s welfare increases by 0.08%, and Canada's welfare declines by 0.06%. We find that intra-bloc trade increases by 118% for Mexico, 11% for Canada and 41% for the U.S. We show that welfare effects from tariff reductions are reduced when the structure of production does not take into account intermediate goods or input-output linkages. Our results highlight the importance of sectoral heterogeneity, intermediate goods and sectoral linkages for the quantification of the welfare gains from tariffs reductions.

That's hilarious!) and then they'd all have a good laugh together. Later, when they met an actual atheist who was trying to explain evolution to them, they wouldn't sit and evaluate it dispassionately. They'd pattern-match back to the ridiculous argument they heard at church, and instead of listening they'd be thinking Hahaha, atheists really are that hilariously stupid!  >> Of course, it's not only Christians who do that.

I have heard Christians use the truth-telling thing argument sometimes (we should believe the Bible because the Bible is correct about many things that can be proven independently, this vouches for the veracity of the whole book, and therefore we should believe it even when it can't be independently proven) many times. If you're familiar enough with the atheist version, and uncharitable enough to Christians, you will pattern-match, miss the subtle difference, and be thinking Hahaha, Christians really are as hilariously stupid as all my atheist friends say!  >> Sometimes even the straw-man argument is unnecessary.

Hahaha! And all the other liberals will think Hahaha, libertarians really are that stupid!  >> Many of you will recognize this as much like the Myers Shuffle. As long as a bunch of atheists get together and laugh at religious people who ask them to read theology before criticizing it, and as long as they have an easily recognizable name for the object of their hilarity like Courtier's Reply, then whenever a religious person asks them to familiarize themselves with theology the atheist can just say Courtier's Reply! and all the other atheists will crack up and think Hahaha, religious people really are that stupid! and they gain status and the theist loses status and at no point do they have to even consider responding to the theist's objection.  >> This tendency reaches its most florid manifestation in the ideological bingo games.

Along with the very rich and the very poor, there developed a white middle class of small planters, independent farmers, city artisans, who, given small rewards for joining forces with merchants and planters, would be a solid buffer against black slaves, frontier Indians, and very poor whites. The growing cities generated more skilled workers, and the governments cultivated the support of white mechanics by protecting them from the competition of both slaves and free Negroes.  >> **As early as 1686, the council in New York ordered that noe Negro or Slave be suffered to work on the bridge as a Porter about any goods either imported or Exported from or into this City.

Surprise: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851015001864  >> China successfully achieved universal health insurance coverage in 2011, representing the largest expansion of insurance coverage in human history. While the achievement is widely recognized, it is still largely unexplored why China was able to attain it within a short period. This study aims to fill the gap. Through a systematic political and socio-economic analysis, it identifies seven major drivers for China's success, including (1) the SARS outbreak as a wake-up call, (2) strong public support for government intervention in health care, (3) renewed political commitment from top leaders, (4) heavy government subsidies, (5) fiscal capacity backed by China's economic power, (6) financial and political responsibilities delegated to local governments and (7) programmatic implementation strategy. Three of the factors seem to be unique to China (i.e., the SARS outbreak, the delegation, and the programmatic strategy.) while the other factors are commonly found in other countries’ insurance expansion experiences. This study also discusses challenges and recommendations for China's health financing, such as reducing financial risk as an immediate task, equalizing benefit across insurance programs as a long-term goal, improving quality by tying provider payment to performance, and controlling costs through coordinated reform initiatives. Finally, it draws lessons for other developing countries.   Conservatism has finally just taken it's toll on this country, the rabid anti-government rhetoric has just put us in a place where China is going to embarrass us.

Craig Venter, head of the Celera Genomics Corporation in Rockville, Md. ''We all evolved in the last 100,000 years from the same small number of tribes that migrated out of Africa and colonized the world.''  >> Dr. Venter and scientists at the National Institutes of Health recently announced that they had put together a draft of the entire sequence of the human genome, and the researchers had unanimously declared, there is only one race -- the human race.  >> Dr. Venter and other researchers say that those traits most commonly used to distinguish one race from another, like skin and eye color, or the width of the nose, are traits controlled by a relatively few number of genes, and thus have been able to change rapidly in response to extreme environmental pressures during the short course of Homo sapiens history.  >> And so equatorial populations evolved dark skin, presumably to protect against ultraviolet radiation, while people in northern latitudes evolved pale skin, the better to produce vitamin D from pale sunlight.  >> ''If you ask what percentage of your genes is reflected in your external appearance, the basis by which we talk about race, the answer seems to be in the range of .01 percent,'' said Dr. Harold P. Freeman, the chief executive, president and director of surgery at North General Hospital in Manhattan, who has studied the issue of biology and race.

I'll just give you some reading.  The things you're talking about are in literally every trade deal, ever. There are studies on those tribunals.  http://natoassociation.ca/some-myths-concerning-investor-state-dispute-settlement/  >> In 2014, Charles N. Brower of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal and Sadie Blanchard of Yale Law School published an article in the Columbia Journal of Transnational law outlining various common myths regarding ISDS. They assert that the balance of power created by international arbitration mechanisms is not nearly as asymmetric as its opponents would allege. They found that tribunals under the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) have ruled in favour of investors in 46% of cases and have typically granted less than 40% of the damages initially sought. This does not indicate any form of systemic bias in favour of investors in international arbitration courts.  >> Additionally, governments possess a wide variety of tools to sanction breaches by investors. Aside from civil damages, governments may also seek criminal sanctions in their own courts. Expropriation of assets may also serve as an enforcement tool for wronged governments. Conversely, in developing countries with politicized judicial systems, arbitration tribunals established by trade agreements often serve as investors’ only recourse in recovering damages from governments.  >> Brower and Blanchard deconstruct allegations of ISDS eroding national sovereignty by pointing out that limiting the scope of legitimate state action is precisely the purpose of international treaties. Criticisms of this type made with respect to ISDS may be equally applied to all international conventions that include enforcement mechanisms, without which they are effectively toothless. Concerns regarding the content that is being enforced may be entirely valid. However, the mere presence of an enforcement mechanism should not be viewed as a point against the TPP.  >> The authors of the article also state that ISDS is highly unlikely to interfere with the imposition of environmental regulations that reduce the return on certain investments. **Not a single environmental regulation has been struck down via ISDS as of the time of writing, and no damages have been awarded to investors pursuant to a claim regarding the enforcement of an environmental law.**  >> **Claims that ISDS leads to “regulatory chill,” where governments are dissuaded from enacting environmental legislation out of concern for litigation in ISDS tribunals, are equally unfounded. To successfully claim damages from a state party, plaintiffs must show that the measure was “pretextual, discriminatory, or lacking in due process.” They must demonstrate that the supposed environmental law in fact targeted them unfairly, either by not similarly binding domestic investors or by blatantly serving as a pretext for favouring domestic industry. Given that no ISDS claim concerning environmental regulation has succeeded to date, it is exceedingly unlikely that investors will be willing to face the steep costs of arbitration in hopes of an improbable victory.**  >> Investor-state dispute resolution has become a standard feature of international trade, benefitting both investors, who are assured of fair treatment in arbitration courts, and developing countries, which benefit from increased levels of foreign investment and an effective subsidy for their judicial systems. Provisions in the TPP establishing such a framework are not unusual in the extent to which they bind governments. Rather, they provide the possibility of enforcement of the landmark trade agreement. While certain groups may have other legitimate grievances regarding the TPP, the inclusion of an ISDS mechanism is in the interest of all parties involved.

To evaluate these arguments, we analyze recent trade data and survey post-NAFTA studies. We find that both the U.S. and Mexico benefit from NAFTA, with much larger relative benefits for Mexico. NAFTA also has had little effect on the U.S. labor market. These results confirm the consensus opinion of economists at the time of the debate. Finally, studies find that trade creation greatly exceeds trade diversion in the region under NAFTA, especially in intermediate goods.  http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_25byqjBle85jqy9  http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_a3jxYtWKoF4vSKx  http://www.nber.org/papers/w18508  >> We build into a Ricardian model sectoral linkages, trade in intermediate goods, and sectoral heterogeneity in production to quantify the trade and welfare effects from tariff changes. We also propose a new method to estimate sectoral trade elasticities consistent with any trade model that delivers a multiplicative gravity equation. We apply our model and use our estimated elasticities to identify the impact of NAFTA's tariff reductions. We find that Mexico's welfare increases by 1.31%, U.S.'s welfare increases by 0.08%, and Canada's welfare declines by 0.06%. We find that intra-bloc trade increases by 118% for Mexico, 11% for Canada and 41% for the U.S. We show that welfare effects from tariff reductions are reduced when the structure of production does not take into account intermediate goods or input-output linkages. Our results highlight the importance of sectoral heterogeneity, intermediate goods and sectoral linkages for the quantification of the welfare gains from tariffs reductions.  Claiming NAFTA was somehow a negative for the American worker isn't supported by reality.

As Sagan said:    >> I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time - when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.  >> The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number one video cassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. Beavis and Butthead remains popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning - not just of science, but of anything - are avoidable, even undesirable. We've arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements - transportation, communications, and all other indus-tries; agriculture, medicine, education, entertainment, protecting the environment; and even the key democratic institution of voting - profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.  >> Avoidable human misery is more often caused not so much by stupidity as by ignorance, particularly our ignorance about ourselves. I worry that, especially as the millen-nium edges nearer, pseudoscience and superstition will seem year by year more tempting, the siren song of unreason more sonorous and attractive.  >> Where have we heard it before?

Several parts agree that there was a net job loss:  Look, I'm not going to attack you here, but that is a lie.  Displacement does not = net job loss.   >> The piece just says that Sanders' quantitative estimate was too high, even though it was based on an an actual report that corroborated his claim. They simply consider it to be an outlier since other reports had different conclusions.  You should read the conclusion.  >> **Sanders said that NAFTA, which Clinton used to support, cost the U.S. economy 800,000 jobs. There is a report from a left-leaning policy group that reached that conclusion. On the other hand, many other nonpartisan reports found that the trade deal produced neither significant job losses nor job gains. This is a result of competing economic models and the challenges of teasing out the effects of NAFTA from everything else that has taken place in the economy.**  Right here, and even then, this is them being generous, we could cite the most credible study on this subject.  https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.15.1.125  >> **We describe the main economic arguments posed for and against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during the U.S. policy debate. To evaluate these arguments, we analyze recent trade data and survey post-NAFTA studies. We find that both the U.S. and Mexico benefit from NAFTA, with much larger relative benefits for Mexico. NAFTA also has had little effect on the U.S. labor market. These results confirm the consensus opinion of economists at the time of the debate. Finally, studies find that trade creation greatly exceeds trade diversion in the region under NAFTA, especially in intermediate goods.**  My point.  >> I'm not defending his claim, but I am defending him from your claim, especially since the very source you cited seems to disagree with you.  Except it doesn't disagree, you decided against reading it.    >> Perhaps, but I'm not suggesting they are good or bad, just showing that what you said was inaccurate: Sanders doesn't say all trade deals are bad.  I'm gonna try to explain this.  If you attack NAFTA, you are against trade deals. NAFTA is about as perfect a trade deal as you can get, it's fair. There's nothing to be against in NAFTA, this report sums this up for me.  http://cornerstonemacro.com/email_tmpl.php?contactid=121278&postid=37761   >> Third, does he go after Mexico or China (or both)? Going after Mexico is a stronger signal that Trump is a protectionist than if he were to go after China. The fact is, the US, Canada, and Mexico have created a free trade zone where tariff rates are basically zero. There is nothing unfair about that unless one does not support free trade. Put another way, what is there to renegotiate when Mexico has no trade barriers against US goods? By contrast, it is true that China is stealing US intellectual property, subsidizing state owned enterprises, and has manipulated its currency. For those who support “fair trade” but aren’t protectionists who are against trade, there are legitimate complaints about Chinese behavior. Moreover, it’s possible Trump could reach an agreement with China that deals with these genuine concerns.  >> The Trump campaign memo that leaked yesterday highlights how weak the case is against NAFTA. The memo identifies four issues of concern with NAFTA: 1) currency manipulation; 2) the ongoing softwood lumber dispute with Canada; 3) country of origin labeling; and 4) environmental and safety standards. Country of origin labeling? That’s pretty weak tea. There is a strong case that it’s the US that is violating NAFTA on the softwood lumber issue, which had been papered over by an agreement that recently expired.  >> Some clients have argued that it is easier and less risky to go after Mexico because it is smaller and less important to the world economy than China, and there is obviously truth in that observation. But we see the risks as higher in Mexico because Trump is less likely to get a real victory (substantive or political) going after NAFTA because there aren’t real abuses. NAFTA created as close to a true free trade zone as one can get in an imperfect world. If Trump targets NAFTA, it is an important signal to investors that not only does he hold strongly protectionist views, he intends to act on them.

And there won’t be any executive orders to address the significant under-representation of men in graduate schools by creating a White House Council on Boys and Men like the executive order issued by President Obama in 2009 to create the “White House Council on Women and Girls.” Finally, despite their stated commitment to “gender equity,” the hundreds of university women’s centers around the country are unlikely to show any concern about the significant gender inequities in graduate school enrollment and degrees, and universities will not be allocating funding to set up men’s centers on college campuses or providing funding for graduate scholarships for men.**  >> Bottom Line: If there is any attention about gender differences in the CGS annual report, it will likely be about the fact that women are a minority in 4 of the 11 fields of graduate study including engineering and computer science (a gender gap which some consider to be a “national crisis”), with calls for greater awareness of female under-representation in STEM graduate fields of study and careers (except for the STEM field of biology, where women are over-represented). But don’t expect any concern about the fact that men have increasingly become the second sex in higher education. The concern about gender imbalances will remain extremely selective, and will only focus on cases when women, not men, are underrepresented and in the minority.

One almost has to wonder if the lady doth protest too much. However, the rest of her word salad above could be cribbed from any number of antivaccine websites. Hell, even Andrew Wakefield concedes that vaccines do good and claims not to be “antivaccine.” Then he routinely launches into the same sort of rant that Dr. Stein engaged in above. An even better example is Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who’s been spewing antivaccine pseudoscience since at least 2005 and yet has the temerity to repeatedly characterize himself as “fiercely pro-vaccine.” In other words, denying being antivaccine counts for nothing if you’re repeating antivaccine tropes. It’s standard practice among antivaccine activists.  >> Dr. Stein is also sadly mistaken about a great many things. For example, her rant about “corporate influence” on the vaccine approval process is straight out of the antivaccine playbook and based on incorrect information. As David Weigel pointed out, the most members of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee work at academic or medical institutions, not drug companies. Yes, there are representatives from drug companies there, but they are a minority, and they are nonvoting members. Moreover, VRBPAC business is nearly all conducted in public. There are only very rarely nonpublic working groups, and all meeting materials are posted to the FDA website. Dr. Stein can peruse them herself going back many years if she so desires. In fact, I urge her to do so. Also, VRBPAC has vigorous screening for financial conflicts of interest. If a member has any that member can’t vote. Finally, I can’t help but note that the antivaccine group the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) has occupied the voting consumer representative slot in the past. Barbara Loe Fisher held it in the past, and, more recently, Vickie Diebold. (For example, check out this 2009 VRBPAC roster). Basically, Dr. Stein is utterly clueless how vaccines are approved and has repeatedly slandered the FDA over it.  >> The issue of mercury in vaccines in the form of the preservative thimerosal was resolved nearly 15 years ago. Thimerosal was removed from childhood vaccines. Moreover, there was never any compelling evidence that thimerosal-containing vaccines had anything to do with autism. It’s something I’ve written about tiem and time again, and I know. As for these “real questions that needed to be addressed,” one notes that these issues have been addressed ad nauseam. Over and over and over again. In every case, in the case of every well-designed study looking at the issue, no epidemiological link between vaccines and autism or vaccines and the diseases antivaccinationists attribute to them has been found. I’ve blogged about this very issue more times than I can remember. I’ve blogged more studies than I can remember. This is not controversial. Vaccines are safe and effective. Just because Dr. Stein is too clueless to realize this doesn’t make these “concerns” scientifically valid.  >> In other words, she basically just doubled down on the same antivaccine dog whistles. The only difference between her and Rand Paul or Chris Christie is that Republicans couch their antivaccine dog whistles in appeals to freedom and parental rights while Dr. Stein couches hers in distrust of big pharma. Either way, the message is the same to antivaccinationists: “I’m with you,” or, at least, “I sympathize with your views.” As I said in other places, if you keep mentioning big pharma and the FDA and how much you distrust them in the context of a discussion about vaccines, you’re blowing antivaccine dog whistles.  >> Not surprisingly, Dr. Stein’s admirers leapt to her defense with scientifically ignorant assertions that she’s not antivaccine because she says she’s not antivaccine.

The goal here is to put a stigma around GMOs, to make them not economically viable.  http://www.agbioforum.org/v6n12/v6n12a13-carter.htm  >> During a short time period in the late 1990s, some food products in the EU were labeled as containing GM ingredients. According to Kalaitzandonakes and Bijman (2003) and Bernauer and Meins (2002), GM products then vanished in the EU. We found additional evidence in Japan, another country that has adopted mandatory labeling, where it is difficult (if not impossible) to find retail food products labeled as containing GM ingredients. Mandatory labeling also exists in Australia and New Zealand, where there is not much choice at the retail level.  >>  Ironically, this fact has not been well publicized, and as a result many observers still question how anyone could be opposed to mandatory labeling if it provides information to consumers. Ignoring the current situation, some European newspapers have predicted that GM foods will invade the retail shelves with the new EU labeling regulations. This has not been the case so far with mandatory labeling; we believe the new EU regulations will do little to provide additional consumer choice.  This is my point.   >> Utter bullshit. Stein is the only candidate this election that listened to the scientific community on climate change.  Except that's blatantly false, why do you think nearly every green org endorsed Clinton?   >> She was the only candidate that was in favor of a single payer health care system  Clinton has done more for single payer in this country than Stein or Sanders could dream of, the difference is she became practical after the 90s.

But even within the same fields, women were paid less than men. Indeed, 17 of 22 industries that hired MBAs last year offered women less money. Women entering finance earned, on average, close to $22,000 less than men, the largest pay differential among companies that drive MBA hiring. Women were offered $12,300 less by tech companies, and $11,500 less by consulting firms than their male peers.**  Right here, we can dig into this, and link the same thing you were already linked, which explains the problem perfectly.    http://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-true-story-of-the-gender-pay-gap-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/  >> **GOLDIN: I think there’s no doubt that they contribute to some degree.

Some of the best studies that we have of the gender pay gap, following individuals longitudinally, show that when they show up right out of college, or out of law school, or after they get their M.B.A. — all the studies that we have indicate that wages are pretty similar then. So if men were better bargainers, they would have been better right then. And it doesn’t look as if they’re better bargainers to a degree that shows up as a very large number.  But further down the pike in their lives, by 10-15 years out, we see very large differences in their pay. But we also see large differences in where they are, in their job titles, and a lot of that occurs a year or two after a kid is born, and it occurs for women and not for men. If anything, men tend to work somewhat harder. And I know that there are many who have done many experiments on the fact that women don’t necessarily like competition as much as men do — they value temporal flexibility, men value income growth — that there are various differences.

National Socialism did promote equality among Germans who passed their racist criteria, and submitted the individual to the will of the state, but did so as a right-wing racial movement which sought a nation of healthy Aryans living in a thousand year Reich, which would be achieved through war. In Nazi theory, a new, unified class was to be formed instead of religious, political and class divides, but this was to be done by rejecting ideologies such as liberalism, capitalism and socialism, and instead pursue a different idea, of the Volksgemeinschaft (people’s community), built on war and race, ‘blood and soil’, and German heritage. Race was to be the heart of Nazism, as opposed to class focused socialism.  >> Before 1934 some in the party did promote anti-capitalist and socialist ideas, such as profit-sharing, nationalization and old-age benefits, but these were merely tolerated by Hitler as he gathered support, dropped once he secured power and often later executed, such as Gregor Strasser. There was no socialist redistribution of wealth or land under Hitler – although some property changed hands thanks to looting and invasion - and while both industrialists and workers were courted, it was the former who benefitted and the latter who found themselves the target of empty rhetoric. Indeed, Hitler became convinced that socialism was intimately connected to his even more long standing hatred - the Jews – and thus hated it even more. Socialists were the first to be locked up in concentration camps. More on the Nazi rise to power and creation of the dictatorship.  >> It’s worth pointing out that all aspects of Nazism had forerunners in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and Hitler tended to cobble his ideology together from them; some historians think that ‘ideology’ gives Hitler too much credit for something which can be hard to pin down. He knew how to take things which made the socialists popular and apply them to give his party a boost. But historian Neil Gregor, in his introduction to a discussion of Nazism which includes many experts, says:  >> **“As with other fascist ideologies and movements it subscribed to an ideology of national renewal, rebirth, and rejuvenation manifesting itself in extreme populist radical nationalism, militarism, and – in contradistinction to many other forms of fascism, extreme biological racism…the movement understood itself to be, and indeed was, a new form of political movement…the anti-Socialist, anti-liberal, and radical nationalist tenets of Nazi ideology applied particularly to the sentiments of a middle class disorientated by the domestic and international upheavals in the inter-war period.” (Neil Gregor, Nazism, Oxford, 2000 p 4-5.)**","False","0","politics","pizzashill","1","t3_5nhx50","0","null","null","1485995543","t5_2cneq"

The methods they used were just the best way to mass produce and get ready for that war.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany  >> Early in his political career, Adolf Hitler regarded economic issues as relatively unimportant. In 1922, Hitler proclaimed[how?][to whom?] that ,world history teaches us that no person has become great through its economy but that a person can very well perish thereby and later concluded that ,the economy is something of secondary importance,.[11] Hitler and the National Socialists held a very strong idealist conception of history, which held that human events are guided by small numbers of exceptional individuals following a higher ideal. They believed that all economic concerns, being purely material, were unworthy of their consideration. Hitler went as far as to blame all previous German governments since Bismarck of having ,subjugated the nation to materialism, by relying more on peaceful economic development than on expansion through war.  >> Hitler's views on economics, beyond his early belief that the economy was of secondary importance, are a matter of debate. On the one hand, he proclaimed in one of his speeches that ,we are socialists, we are enemies of today's capitalistic economic system[16] but he was clear to point out that his interpretation of socialism ,has nothing to do with Marxian Socialism saying that ,Marxism is anti-property; true Socialism is not.,[17] At a later time, Hitler said: ,Socialism! That is an unfortunate word altogether... What does socialism really mean? If people have something to eat and their pleasures, then they have their socialism.,[15] The term that Hitler later wished he had used for his political party name was “social revolutionary.”[18] In private, Hitler also said that ,I absolutely insist on protecting private property... we must encourage private initiative,.[19] On yet another occasion he qualified that statement by saying that the government should have the power to regulate the use of private property for the good of the nation.[20] Shortly after coming to power, Hitler told a confidant: ,There is no license any more, no private sphere where the individual belongs to himself. That is socialism, not such trivial matters as the possibility of privately owning the means of production. Such things mean nothing if I subject people to a kind of discipline they can't escape...What need have we to socialize banks and factories? We socialize human beings,.[21] He clearly believed that the lack of a precise economic programme was one of the Nazi Party's strengths, saying: ,The basic feature of our economic theory is that we have no theory at all.,[22] While not espousing a specific economic philosophy, Hitler employed anti-semitic themes to attack economic systems in other countries, associating ethnic Jews with both communism (,Jewish Bolsheviks,) and capitalism, both of which he opposed.[23][24] Hitler also believed that individuals within a nation battled with each other for survival, and that such ruthless competition was good for the health of the nation, because it promoted ,superior individuals, to higher positions in society.[25] At Berchtesgaden in July 1944, Hitler gave his final speech in front of an audience. Drafted by Albert Speer, he emphasised the ,self-responsibility of industry,. After the war was won ,private initiative of German business will experience its greatest moment,. Hitler also expressed his belief in ,the further development of humanity through the promotion of private initiative, in which alone I see the precondition for all real progress.,","False","0","politics","pizzashill","1","t3_5nhx50","0","null","null","1485997956","t5_2cneq"

While the achievement is widely recognized, it is still largely unexplored why China was able to attain it within a short period. This study aims to fill the gap. Through a systematic political and socio-economic analysis, it identifies seven major drivers for China's success, including (1) the SARS outbreak as a wake-up call, (2) strong public support for government intervention in health care, (3) renewed political commitment from top leaders, (4) heavy government subsidies, (5) fiscal capacity backed by China's economic power, (6) financial and political responsibilities delegated to local governments and (7) programmatic implementation strategy. Three of the factors seem to be unique to China (i.e., the SARS outbreak, the delegation, and the programmatic strategy.) while the other factors are commonly found in other countries’ insurance expansion experiences. This study also discusses challenges and recommendations for China's health financing, such as reducing financial risk as an immediate task, equalizing benefit across insurance programs as a long-term goal, improving quality by tying provider payment to performance, and controlling costs through coordinated reform initiatives. Finally, it draws lessons for other developing countries.

What if these different despised groups-the Indians, the slaves, the poor whites-should combine? Even before diere were so many blacks, in the seventeenth century, there was, as Abbot Smith puts it, ,a lively fear that servants would join with Negroes or Indians to overcome the small number of masters.,  >> There was little chance that whites and Indians would combine in North America as they were doing in South and Central America, where the shortage of women, and the use of Indians on the plantations, led to daily contact. Only in Georgia and South Carolina, where white women were scarce, was there some sexual mixing of white men and Indian women. In general, the Indian had been pushed out of sight, out of touch. One fact disturbed: whites would run off to join Indian tribes, or would be captured in battle and brought up among the Indians, and when this happened the whites, given a chance to leave, chose to stay in the Indian culture, Indians, having the choice, almost never decided to join the whites. Hector St. Jean Crevecoeur, the Frenchman who lived in America for almost twenty years, told, in Letters from an American Farmer, how children captured during the Seven Years' War and found by their parents, grown up and living with Indians, would refuse to leave their new families.  >> ,There must be in their social bond he said, ,something singularly captivating, and far superior to anything to be boasted among us; for thousands of Europeans are Indians, and we have no examples of even one of those Aborigines having from choice become Europeans., But this affected few people. In general, the Indian was kept at a distance. And the colonial officialdom had found a way of alleviating the danger: by monopolizing the good land on the eastern seaboard, they forced landless whites to move westward to the frontier, there to encounter the Indians and to be a buffer for the seaboard rich against Indian troubles, white becoming more dependent on the government for protection. Bacon's Rebellion was instructive: to conciliate a diminishing Indian population at the expense of infuriating a coalition of white frontiersmen was very risky. Better to make war on the Indian, gain the support of the white, divert possible class conflict by turning poor whites against Indians for the security of the elite.  >> Might blacks and Indians combine against the white enemy? In the northern colonies (except on Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Rhode Island, where there was close contact and sexual mixing), there was not much opportunity for Africans and Indians to meet in large numbers. New York had the largest slave population in the North, and there was some contact between blacks and Indians, as in 1712 when Africans and Indians joined in an insurrection. But this was quickly suppressed. In the Carolinas, however, whites were outnumbered by black slaves and nearby Indian tribes; in the 1750s, 25,000 whites faced 40,000 black slaves, with 60,000 Creek, Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Indians in the area. Gary Nash writes: ,Indian uprisings that punctuated the colonial period and a succession of slave uprisings and insurrectionary plots that were nipped in the bud kept South Carolinians sickeningly aware that only through the greatest vigilance and through policies designed to keep their enemies divided could they hope to remain in control of the situation., Edmund Morgan, on the basis of his careful study of slavery in Virginia, sees racism not as ,natural, to black-white difference, but something coming out of class scorn, a realistic device for control. ,If freemen with disappointed hopes should make common cause with slaves of desperate hope, the results might be worse than anything Bacon had done. The answer to the problem, obvious if unspoken and only gradually recognized, was racism, to separate dangerous free whites from dangerous black slaves by a screen of racial contempt.,  >> There was still another control which became handy as the colonies grew, and which had crucial consequences for the continued rule of the elite throughout American history. Along with the very rich and the very poor, there developed a white middle class of small planters, independent farmers, city artisans, who, given small rewards for joining forces with merchants and planters, would be a solid buffer against black slaves, frontier Indians, and very poor whites. The growing cities generated more skilled workers, and the governments cultivated the support of white mechanics by protecting them from the competition of both slaves and free Negroes.  >> As early as 1686, the council in New York ordered that ,noe Negro or Slave be suffered to work on the bridge as a Porter about any goods either imported or Exported from or into this City., In the southern towns too, white craftsmen and traders were protected from Negro competition. In 1764 the South Carolina legislature prohibited Charleston masters from employing Negroes or other slaves as mechanics or in handicraft trades. Middle-class Americans might be invited to join a new elite by attacks against the corruption of the established rich. The New Yorker Cadwallader Golden, in his Address to the Freeholders in 1747, attacked the wealthy as tax dodgers unconcerned with the welfare of others (although he himself was wealthy) and spoke for the honesty and dependability of ,the midling rank of mankind, in whom citizens could best trust ,our liberty & Property., This was to become a critically important rhetorical device for the rule of the few, who would speak to the many of ,our, liberty, ,our, property, ,our, country.

He feared the middle class could be driven to a right-wing viewpoint, ,making them ripe for the plucking by some guy on horseback promising a return to the vanished verities of yesterday.,[4] His stated motive: ,I love this goddamn country, and we're going to take it back.,**","False","0","politics","pizzashill","6","t3_5nn37t","0","null","null","1486003091","t5_2cneq"

A) Literally every ,neoliberal, country has seen rapid increases in standard of living. You claiming ,neoliberalism, has led to wealth inequality doesn't actually make sense, because those neoliberal countries are pretty much the most equal on the planet.  B) You don't actually understand globalism, or what causes globalism.

An accompanying assertion is that virtually all income growth over the past three decades bypassed middle America and accrued almost entirely to the rich.  >> The findings reported here—and summarized in Chart 8—refute those claims. Careful analysis shows that the incomes of most types of middle American households have increased substantially over the past three decades. These results are consistent with recent research showing that the largest income increases occurred at the top end of the income distribution. But the outsized gains of the rich do not mean that middle America stagnated.  >> Why does the debate about middle America matter? Because an accurate assessment of the economic progress of middle America is a crucial input in formulating good public policy. Claims of long-term middle America stagnation—such as those quoted at the beginning of this article—are often part of a broader argument about the adverse impact of globalization, outsourcing and free trade. And middle class stagnation is used as motivation for a specific set of policies. But if middle America has not stagnated—as this analysis has shown—then this motivation for those policies is without merit.  >> Furthermore, if it is understood that middle America has indeed experienced substantial gains, policy priorities may change. For example, more emphasis might be placed on policies that promote continued economic growth or that target deeply rooted poverty rather than middle class stagnation. But regardless of the specific policy, policymakers and the public should base their decisions on an accurate assessment of how the economy has impacted and continues to impact people’s lives.

Some unsavory people try to use them to prove that white people are the real victims or the media is biased against white people or something. Other people who are very nice and optimistic use them to show that some white people have developed some self-awareness and are willing to engage in self-criticism.  >> But I think the situation with “white” is much the same as the situation with “American” – it can either mean what it says, or be a code word for the Red Tribe.  >> (except on the blog Stuff White People Like, where it obviously serves as a code word for the Blue tribe. I don’t know, guys. I didn’t do it.)  >> I realize that’s making a strong claim, but it would hardly be without precedent. When people say things like “gamers are misogynist”, do they mean the 52% of gamers who are women? Do they mean every one of the 59% of Americans from every walk of life who are known to play video or computer games occasionally? No. “Gamer” is a coded reference to the Gray Tribe, the half-branched-off collection of libertarianish tech-savvy nerds, and everyone knows it.

Everyone knows exactly who we mean when we say “urban youth”, and them being young people who live in a city has only the most tenuous of relations to the actual concept.  >> And I’m saying words like “American” and “white” work the same way. Bill Clinton was the “first black President”, but if Herman Cain had won in 2012 he’d have been the 43rd white president. And when an angry white person talks at great length about how much he hates “white dudes”, he is not being humble and self-critical.  >> Spending your entire life insulting the other tribe and talking about how terrible they are makes you look, well, tribalistic. It is definitely not high class. So when members of the Blue Tribe decide to dedicate their entire life to yelling about how terrible the Red Tribe is, they make sure that instead of saying “the Red Tribe”, they say “America”, or “white people”, or “straight white men”. That way it’s humble self-criticism. They are so interested in justice that they are willing to critique their own beloved side, much as it pains them to do so.

They appeal to the fact that this is definitely the way it works in the Red Tribe’s dark-matter-universe, and that’s in the same country so it has to be the same community for all intents and purposes.

It's a common meme from far lefties.  http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2016/08/01/jill-stein-and-left-wing-antivaccine-dog-whistles/  >> Regular readers will recognize this as the gambit I like to call, “I’m not ‘antivaccine.’ I’m pro-safe vaccine and don’t trust the FDA and big pharma.” I will grant that Dr. Stein was a little more—shall we say?—emphatic in her concession that vaccines do good than the average antivaccinationist making these arguments. One almost has to wonder if the lady doth protest too much. However, the rest of her word salad above could be cribbed from any number of antivaccine websites. Hell, even Andrew Wakefield concedes that vaccines do good and claims not to be “antivaccine.” Then he routinely launches into the same sort of rant that Dr. Stein engaged in above. An even better example is Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who’s been spewing antivaccine pseudoscience since at least 2005 and yet has the temerity to repeatedly characterize himself as “fiercely pro-vaccine.” In other words, denying being antivaccine counts for nothing if you’re repeating antivaccine tropes. It’s standard practice among antivaccine activists.  >> Dr. Stein is also sadly mistaken about a great many things. For example, her rant about “corporate influence” on the vaccine approval process is straight out of the antivaccine playbook and based on incorrect information. As David Weigel pointed out, the most members of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee work at academic or medical institutions, not drug companies. Yes, there are representatives from drug companies there, but they are a minority, and they are nonvoting members. Moreover, VRBPAC business is nearly all conducted in public. There are only very rarely nonpublic working groups, and all meeting materials are posted to the FDA website. Dr. Stein can peruse them herself going back many years if she so desires. In fact, I urge her to do so. Also, VRBPAC has vigorous screening for financial conflicts of interest. If a member has any that member can’t vote. Finally, I can’t help but note that the antivaccine group the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) has occupied the voting consumer representative slot in the past. Barbara Loe Fisher held it in the past, and, more recently, Vickie Diebold. (For example, check out this 2009 VRBPAC roster). Basically, Dr. Stein is utterly clueless how vaccines are approved and has repeatedly slandered the FDA over it.  They do it with vaccines as well, they do it with anything related to the FDA.

Going after Mexico is a stronger signal that Trump is a protectionist than if he were to go after China. The fact is, the US, Canada, and Mexico have created a free trade zone where tariff rates are basically zero. There is nothing unfair about that unless one does not support free trade. Put another way, what is there to renegotiate when Mexico has no trade barriers against US goods? By contrast, it is true that China is stealing US intellectual property, subsidizing state owned enterprises, and has manipulated its currency. For those who support “fair trade” but aren’t protectionists who are against trade, there are legitimate complaints about Chinese behavior. Moreover, it’s possible Trump could reach an agreement with China that deals with these genuine concerns.  >> The Trump campaign memo that leaked yesterday highlights how weak the case is against NAFTA. The memo identifies four issues of concern with NAFTA: 1) currency manipulation; 2) the ongoing softwood lumber dispute with Canada; 3) country of origin labeling; and 4) environmental and safety standards. Country of origin labeling? That’s pretty weak tea. There is a strong case that it’s the US that is violating NAFTA on the softwood lumber issue, which had been papered over by an agreement that recently expired.  >> Some clients have argued that it is easier and less risky to go after Mexico because it is smaller and less important to the world economy than China, and there is obviously truth in that observation. But we see the risks as higher in Mexico because Trump is less likely to get a real victory (substantive or political) going after NAFTA because there aren’t real abuses. NAFTA created as close to a true free trade zone as one can get in an imperfect world.

To evaluate these arguments, we analyze recent trade data and survey post-NAFTA studies. We find that both the U.S. and Mexico benefit from NAFTA, with much larger relative benefits for Mexico. NAFTA also has had little effect on the U.S. labor market. These results confirm the consensus opinion of economists at the time of the debate. Finally, studies find that trade creation greatly exceeds trade diversion in the region under NAFTA, especially in intermediate goods.**  So that's one.

What if these different despised groups-the Indians, the slaves, the poor whites-should combine? Even before diere were so many blacks, in the seventeenth century, there was, as Abbot Smith puts it, ,a lively fear that servants would join with Negroes or Indians to overcome the small number of masters.,  >> There was little chance that whites and Indians would combine in North America as they were doing in South and Central America, where the shortage of women, and the use of Indians on the plantations, led to daily contact. Only in Georgia and South Carolina, where white women were scarce, was there some sexual mixing of white men and Indian women. In general, the Indian had been pushed out of sight, out of touch. One fact disturbed: whites would run off to join Indian tribes, or would be captured in battle and brought up among the Indians, and when this happened the whites, given a chance to leave, chose to stay in the Indian culture, Indians, having the choice, almost never decided to join the whites. Hector St. Jean Crevecoeur, the Frenchman who lived in America for almost twenty years, told, in Letters from an American Farmer, how children captured during the Seven Years' War and found by their parents, grown up and living with Indians, would refuse to leave their new families.  >> ,There must be in their social bond he said, ,something singularly captivating, and far superior to anything to be boasted among us; for thousands of Europeans are Indians, and we have no examples of even one of those Aborigines having from choice become Europeans.,  >> But this affected few people. In general, the Indian was kept at a distance. And the colonial officialdom had found a way of alleviating the danger: by monopolizing the good land on the eastern seaboard, they forced landless whites to move westward to the frontier, there to encounter the Indians and to be a buffer for the seaboard rich against Indian troubles, white becoming more dependent on the government for protection. Bacon's Rebellion was instructive: to conciliate a diminishing Indian population at the expense of infuriating a coalition of white frontiersmen was very risky. Better to make war on the Indian, gain the support of the white, divert possible class conflict by turning poor whites against Indians for the security of the elite.  >> Might blacks and Indians combine against the white enemy? In the northern colonies (except on Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Rhode Island, where there was close contact and sexual mixing), there was not much opportunity for Africans and Indians to meet in large numbers. New York had the largest slave population in the North, and there was some contact between blacks and Indians, as in 1712 when Africans and Indians joined in an insurrection. But this was quickly suppressed. In the Carolinas, however, whites were outnumbered by black slaves and nearby Indian tribes; in the 1750s, 25,000 whites faced 40,000 black slaves, with 60,000 Creek, Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Indians in the area. Gary Nash writes: ,Indian uprisings that punctuated the colonial period and a succession of slave uprisings and insurrectionary plots that were nipped in the bud kept South Carolinians sickeningly aware that only through the greatest vigilance and through policies designed to keep their enemies divided could they hope to remain in control of the situation.,  >> Edmund Morgan, on the basis of his careful study of slavery in Virginia, sees racism not as ,natural, to black-white difference, but something coming out of class scorn, a realistic device for control. ,If freemen with disappointed hopes should make common cause with slaves of desperate hope, the results might be worse than anything Bacon had done. The answer to the problem, obvious if unspoken and only gradually recognized, was racism, to separate dangerous free whites from dangerous black slaves by a screen of racial contempt.,  >> There was still another control which became handy as the colonies grew, and which had crucial consequences for the continued rule of the elite throughout American history. Along with the very rich and the very poor, there developed a white middle class of small planters, independent farmers, city artisans, who, given small rewards for joining forces with merchants and planters, would be a solid buffer against black slaves, frontier Indians, and very poor whites. The growing cities generated more skilled workers, and the governments cultivated the support of white mechanics by protecting them from the competition of both slaves and free Negroes.  >> As early as 1686, the council in New York ordered that ,noe Negro or Slave be suffered to work on the bridge as a Porter about any goods either imported or Exported from or into this City., In the southern towns too, white craftsmen and traders were protected from Negro competition. In 1764 the South Carolina legislature prohibited Charleston masters from employing Negroes or other slaves as mechanics or in handicraft trades. Middle-class Americans might be invited to join a new elite by attacks against the corruption of the established rich. The New Yorker Cadwallader Golden, in his Address to the Freeholders in 1747, attacked the wealthy as tax dodgers unconcerned with the welfare of others (although he himself was wealthy) and spoke for the honesty and dependability of ,the midling rank of mankind, in whom citizens could best trust ,our liberty & Property.,  >> This was to become a critically important rhetorical device for the rule of the few, who would speak to the many of ,our, liberty, ,our, property, ,our, country.

Programs were not universal to start with and were originally conceived as a means of maintaining incomes and buying political allegiance of the workers.**   Not only that, but do you even know anything about Hillary Clinton?

If you think Donald Trump is pushing single payer you're on one, dude.  You can go read Clinton's private speeches on this.  >> *Clinton Said Single-Payer Health Care Systems “Can Get Costs Down,” And “Is As Good Or Better On Primary Care,” But “They Do Impose Things Like Waiting Times.” *“If you look at countries that are comparable, like Switzerland or Germany, for example, they have mixed systems. They don't have just a single-payer system, but they have very clear controls over budgeting and accountability. If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here.” [Hillary Clinton remarks to ECGR Grand Rapids, 6/17/13]  >> *Clinton Cited President Johnson’s Success In Establishing Medicare And Medicaid And Said She Wanted To See The U.S. Have Universal Health Care Like In Canada.* “You know, on healthcare we are the prisoner of our past. The way we got to develop any kind of medical insurance program was during World War II when companies facing shortages of workers began to offer healthcare benefits as an inducement for employment. So from the early 1940s healthcare was seen as a privilege connected to employment. And after the war when soldiers came back and went back into the market there was a lot of competition, because the economy was so heated up. So that model continued. And then of course our large labor unions bargained for healthcare with the employers that their members worked for. So from the early 1940s until the early 1960s we did not have any Medicare, or our program for the poor called Medicaid until President Johnson was able to get both passed in 1965. So the employer model continued as the primary means by which working people got health insurance. People over 65 were eligible for Medicare. Medicaid, which was a partnership, a funding partnership between the federal government and state governments, provided some, but by no means all poor people with access to healthcare. So what we've been struggling with certainly Harry Truman, then Johnson was successful on Medicare and Medicaid, but didn't touch the employer based system, then actually Richard Nixon made a proposal that didn't go anywhere, but was quite far reaching. Then with my husband's administration we worked very hard to come up with a system, but we were very much constricted by the political realities that if you had your insurance from your employer you were reluctant to try anything else. And so we were trying to build a universal system around the employer-based system. And indeed now with President Obama's legislative success in getting the Affordable Care Act passed that is what we've done. We still have primarily an employer-based system, but we now have people able to get subsidized insurance. So we have health insurance companies playing a major role in the provision of healthcare, both to the employed whose employers provide health insurance, and to those who are working but on their own are not able to afford it and their employers either don't provide it, or don't provide it at an affordable price. We are still struggling. We've made a lot of progress. Ten million Americans now have insurance who didn't have it before the Affordable Care Act, and that is a great step forward. (Applause.) And what we're going to have to continue to do is monitor what the costs are and watch closely to see whether employers drop more people from insurance so that they go into what we call the health exchange system. So we're really just at the beginning. But we do have Medicare for people over 65. And you couldn't, I don't think, take it away if you tried, because people are very satisfied with it, but we also have a lot of political and financial resistance to expanding that system to more people. **So we're in a learning period as we move forward with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. And I'm hoping that whatever the shortfalls or the glitches have been, which in a big piece of legislation you're going to have, those will be remedied and we can really take a hard look at what's succeeding, fix what isn't, and keep moving forward to get to affordable universal healthcare coverage like you have here in Canada.

And that has not been addressed. I crossed party lines in 1994 and built a coalition of Republicans that passed the crime bill. If it were not for that, we would not have drug courts right now. We would not have community policing.

Police officers must be equipped with the antidote to a heroin overdose or an opioid overdose, known as Narcan. They should be able to administer it. So should firefighters and others. **We have to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and instead, move it to where it belongs, as a health issue.

Women are over 60% of the college population with a degree gap in their favor:  http://www.aei.org/publication/stunning-college-degree-gap-women-have-earned-almost-10-million-more-college-degrees-than-men-since-1982/  https://www.aei.org/publication/women-earned-majority-of-doctoral-degrees-in-2014-for-6th-straight-year-and-outnumber-men-in-grad-school-136-to-100/   >> Here’s my prediction – the facts that: a) men are underrepresented in graduate school enrollment overall (100 men were enrolled in 2014 for every 136.4 women), b) men received fewer master’s (41% of the total) and doctoral degrees (47.8% of the total) than women in 2014, and c) men were underrepresented in 7 out of 11 graduate fields of study at both the master’s and doctoral levels last year will get no attention at all from feminists, gender activists, women’s centers, the media, universities, and anybody in the higher education industry.  >> Additionally, there will be no calls for government studies, or increased government funding to address the significant gender disparities favoring women in graduate schools, and nobody will refer to the gender graduate school enrollment and degree gaps favoring women as a problem or a “crisis.” Further, neither President Obama nor Congress will address the gender graduate enrollment and degree gaps favoring women by invoking the Title IX gender-equity law, like they have threatened to do for the gender gap in some college math and science programs. And there won’t be any executive orders to address the significant under-representation of men in graduate schools by creating a White House Council on Boys and Men like the executive order issued by President Obama in 2009 to create the “White House Council on Women and Girls.” Finally, despite their stated commitment to “gender equity,” the hundreds of university women’s centers around the country are unlikely to show any concern about the significant gender inequities in graduate school enrollment and degrees, and universities will not be allocating funding to set up men’s centers on college campuses or providing funding for graduate scholarships for men.  >> Bottom Line: If there is any attention about gender differences in the CGS annual report, it will likely be about the fact that women are a minority in 4 of the 11 fields of graduate study including engineering and computer science (a gender gap which some consider to be a “national crisis”), with calls for greater awareness of female under-representation in STEM graduate fields of study and careers (except for the STEM field of biology, where women are over-represented). But don’t expect any concern about the fact that men have increasingly become the second sex in higher education. The concern about gender imbalances will remain extremely selective, and will only focus on cases when women, not men, are underrepresented and in the minority.

You’re less likely to be interrupted when you speak – studies of men and women showed that both interrupted women more than men.  That's 2.  >> 3. You’re not automatically assumed to not know what you’re talking about – or subjected to mansplaining.  That's 3.  >> 4. **Common vocabulary favors your gender as the default, with language like “mankind” and “foreman,”**  and dictionary definitions of words created by men.  And closed, person has no idea how language works or where these words came from.  To give you an example of how cringe this one is:  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mankind  >> **,the human race,, c. 1300, earlier man-kende (early 13c.), from man (n.) + kind (n.). Replaced Old English mancynn ,human race., Also used occasionally in Middle English for ,male persons, (late 14c.), but otherwise preserving the original gender neutrality of man (n.). For ,menfolk, the male sex,, menkind (late 14c.) and menskind (1590s) have been used.**     >> **Before “man” meant a male, the word “wer” or “wǣpmann” was commonly used to refer to “male human”.  This word almost completely died out around the 1300s, but survives somewhat in words like “werewolf”, which literally means “man wolf”.**  >> **Largely due to the stigma that using the word “man” meaning “humans” is supposedly sexist, despite its original meaning, the use of the word “man” in that fashion has all but disappeared in the last 50-100 years, with it now only showing up in words like “human” and “mankind” as referring to both male and female.  Even those instances still garners quite a bit of controversy in terms of being thought of as sexist, despite these words predating the point when “man” meant “male” only.**  Couldn't make it to 5, the fact the author had no idea where the word ,mankind, came from triggered me, I hope to god this isn't where you get your news, or your views.  /u/etyactsfomfabtl ","False","0","politics","pizzashill","5","t3_5oizu1","0","null","null","1486143927","t5_2cneq"

B) LOL, Clinton was practical, she always supported ,single payer.,  Here private speech, for example:  >> *Clinton Said Single-Payer Health Care Systems “Can Get Costs Down,” And “Is As Good Or Better On Primary Care,” But “They Do Impose Things Like Waiting Times.” *“If you look at countries that are comparable, like Switzerland or Germany, for example, they have mixed systems. They don't have just a single-payer system, but they have very clear controls over budgeting and accountability. If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here.” [Hillary Clinton remarks to ECGR Grand Rapids, 6/17/13]  Or another one:  >> **Clinton Cited President Johnson’s Success In Establishing Medicare And Medicaid And Said She Wanted To See The U.S. Have Universal Health Care Like In Canada.** “You know, on healthcare we are the prisoner of our past. The way we got to develop any kind of medical insurance program was during World War II when companies facing shortages of workers began to offer healthcare benefits as an inducement for employment. So from the early 1940s healthcare was seen as a privilege connected to employment. And after the war when soldiers came back and went back into the market there was a lot of competition, because the economy was so heated up. So that model continued. And then of course our large labor unions bargained for healthcare with the employers that their members worked for. So from the early 1940s until the early 1960s we did not have any Medicare, or our program for the poor called Medicaid until President Johnson was able to get both passed in 1965. So the employer model continued as the primary means by which working people got health insurance. People over 65 were eligible for Medicare. Medicaid, which was a partnership, a funding partnership between the federal government and state governments, provided some, but by no means all poor people with access to healthcare. So what we've been struggling with certainly Harry Truman, then Johnson was successful on Medicare and Medicaid, but didn't touch the employer based system, then actually Richard Nixon made a proposal that didn't go anywhere, but was quite far reaching. Then with my husband's administration we worked very hard to come up with a system, but we were very much constricted by the political realities that if you had your insurance from your employer you were reluctant to try anything else. And so we were trying to build a universal system around the employer-based system. And indeed now with President Obama's legislative success in getting the Affordable Care Act passed that is what we've done. We still have primarily an employer-based system, but we now have people able to get subsidized insurance. So we have health insurance companies playing a major role in the provision of healthcare, both to the employed whose employers provide health insurance, and to those who are working but on their own are not able to afford it and their employers either don't provide it, or don't provide it at an affordable price. We are still struggling. We've made a lot of progress. Ten million Americans now have insurance who didn't have it before the Affordable Care Act, and that is a great step forward. (Applause.) And what we're going to have to continue to do is monitor what the costs are and watch closely to see whether employers drop more people from insurance so that they go into what we call the health exchange system. So we're really just at the beginning. But we do have Medicare for people over 65. And you couldn't, I don't think, take it away if you tried, because people are very satisfied with it, but we also have a lot of political and financial resistance to expanding that system to more people. So we're in a learning period as we move forward with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. **And I'm hoping that whatever the shortfalls or the glitches have been, which in a big piece of legislation you're going to have, those will be remedied and we can really take a hard look at what's succeeding, fix what isn't, and keep moving forward to get to affordable universal healthcare coverage like you have here in Canada.** [Clinton Speech For tinePublic – Saskatoon, CA, 1/21/15]","False","0","politics","pizzashill","1","t3_5onqn5","0","null","null","1486145970","t5_2cneq"

Feminism, as a movement, has become nothing but a platform for professional victims to use to cry oppression even when the empirical data conflicts with that claim.  One of my favorite articles that sums up why feminism needs to die and be replaced by something else:  http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/01/untitled/    >> Go back to the original Amanda Marcotte article. Check the title. “MIT Professor Explains The Real Oppression Is Having To Talk To Women”.  >> That phrasing, “the real oppression is…”, carries a pretty loaded assumption. I’d say “hides a pretty loaded assumption”, but it doesn’t seem to be doing much work to hide it.  >> If you look through Marcotte’s work, you find this same phrasing quite often. “Some antifeminist guy is ranting at me about how men are the ones who are really oppressed because of the draft” (source). And she’s not the only one. If you Google the term “are the ones who are really oppressed”, you can find an nice collection of people using this exact phraseology, including a few examples from a charming site called “Nerds Fucking Suck”.  >> But Aaronson is admitting about a hundred times that he recognizes the importance of the ways women are oppressed. He’s not saying his suffering is worse than women’s in every way, just that it’s really bad and maybe this is not the place where “male privilege” should be invoked. The “is really oppressed” isn’t taken from him, it’s assumed by Marcotte. Her obvious worldview is – since privilege and oppression are a completely one dimensional axis, for Aaronson to claim that there is anything whatsoever that has ever been bad for men must be interpreted as a claim that they are the ones who are really oppressed and therefore women are not the ones who are really oppressed and therefore nothing whatsoever has ever been bad for women. By Insane Moon Logic, it sort of makes sense.  >> As a result, Marcotte is incapable of acknowledging that Aaronson feels pain or has feelings more complicated than “all women exist solely to be my slaves”. She has to be a jerk to him, otherwise it would be a tacit admission that he has problems, which means only he has problems, which means no woman has ever had problems, which means all women are oppressors.

She became internationally famous for having started the first domestic violence shelter in the modern world. Haven House[2] is often cited as the first women's refuge (called women's shelters in Canada and the U.S.), but at the time of their founding they only worked to help the mentally ill transition from committed life in a hospital to life in the outside world. By contrast the refuge started by Erin Pizzey was focused on removing victims of domestic abuse from their abusers, in an attempt to break the cycle. Chiswick Women's Aid, in 1971,[3] the organisation known today as Refuge.  >> Pizzey has been the subject of death threats and boycotts because of her research into the claim that most domestic violence is reciprocal, and that women are equally capable of violence as men. Pizzey has said that the threats were from militant feminists.[4][5][6]  >> In 1981, Pizzey moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, while targeted by harassment, death threats, bomb threats[33] and defamation campaigns,[6] and dealing with overwork, near collapse, cardiac disease and mental strain.[34] In particular, according to Pizzey, the charity Scottish Women's Aid ,made it their business to hand out leaflets claiming that [she] believed that women 'invited violence' and 'provoked male violence',.[6] She states that the turning point was the intervention of the bomb squad, who required all of her mail to be processed by them before she could receive it, as a ,controversial public figure,.[35]  >> Having moved to Santa Fe to write, Pizzey promptly became involved in running a refuge in New Mexico, as well as dealing with sexual abusers and paedophiles.[6] Pizzey said of this work, ,I discovered that there were just as many women paedophiles as there were men. Women go undetected, as usual. Working against paedophiles is a very dangerous business.,[25] Whilst living in Santa Fe, one of her dogs was shot and two others were stolen, which she claims was a result of racist neighbors.[33] Her family suffered new harassment following the publication of her 1982 book Prone to Violence. Pizzey links much of the harassment to militant feminists and their objections to her research, findings and work.[6][33][36] Describing the harassment, Deborah Ross of The Independent wrote that ,the feminist sisterhood went bonkers,.","False","0","politics","pizzashill","-5","t3_5p2rxi","0","null","null","1486204142","t5_2cneq"

So during the first quarter of the year steel producers began to push for higher prices and they had the market power of steel shortages to force through some price increases.6 In addition, a host of antidumping and countervailing duties went into effect at the end of 2001, raising steel costs. Antidumping and countervailing duties were imposed on imports of hot-rolled carbon steel flat products imported from 11 countries between September and December 2001, boosting costs – or eliminating foreign supply -- of this important product. Antidumping or countervailing duties were imposed on imports of stainless steel bar from five countries in March 2002 with the same consequences. These duties were imposed in addition to the steel tariffs. Ultimately unsuccessful investigations were launched against imports of oil country tubular goods and cold rolled carbon sheet, disrupting supplies and prices of these products during the course of the investigations.  >> **The steel supply shortage problem deepened because of uncertainty associated with the tariffs.** **Importers stopped ordering steel in January waiting to see what the President would decide.**  **Thus, product that would have been entering the market in March, April and May was absent.

And that’s a number that has increased. In early 1970’s it was .59 and there was a mantra, “59 cents on a dollar, that’s not enough, OK?  We are equal to men, we deserve more.”  So, is this for equal work?  Is it equal individuals?  What economists do is they use data to figure out whether the individuals are the same; they try to make them comparable as possible; they squeeze out these differences and productive attributes; they look for individuals who have the same education, the same labor-force participation rates over their life cycle, etc.  And they squeeze those out and we still get a number that’s less than one. **So, does that mean that women are receiving lower pay for equal work?  That is possibly the case in certain places, but by and large, it’s not that. It’s something else.**  >> GOLDIN: It’s hard to find the smoking guns, OK?  The smoking guns existed in the past. I have found many a smoking gun where you find actual evidence of firms saying, for example, “I do not hire Nroes.” Or, “I do not hire women.” I mean, you actually find these in 1939.  We don’t find those smoking guns now, but what we do try to do is hold everything constant that we can hold, get the best data that we can get. And what remains we don’t call discrimination, we call wage discrimination. Discrimination is such a loaded word that we don’t want to use that, so we use quotes around “wage discrimination.” And so the first thing is, what type of data do you need to do that? It would be incredibly rich data. And a couple of people have put together data using administrative records that are phenomenally good data that can hold lots of things constant, that can track individuals over their lifetimes and get to the answer. **And the answer is that it’s a pretty small number, this number for wage discrimination once you hold lots of things constant.  It’s probably there, but we’re not quite certain whether these differences are due to the fact that women, even those without kids, have more responsibilities or take more responsibilities in their own families — taking care of their parents, for example.  So the answer is that we don’t have tons of evidence that it’s true discrimination.**  >> **GOLDIN: I like to think about an individual who gets a degree — let’s say a law degree — and it’s a woman, and now I have an individual a man who gets a law degree. And they graduate from law school and they’re both equally brilliant, and they both get jobs in approximately the same type of firm. By and large they’re going to earn approximately the same amount when they start. Things will continue in their lives — they’ll both perhaps find partners, get married, have kids. It’s often the case that women will leave the very large law firms that put a lot of time demands on them and go to smaller firms or become corporate counsel, become part-time corporate counsel, perhaps, for a while. They will go to small firms where the workload is somewhat different. They may work in fact the same number of hours, but they may work hours that are their hours rather than the hours imposed on them by the firm. The woman will then begin to make — if she’s the one who did this — she will make considerably less than the man.  And a lot of what we see — not all of it — but a lot of what we see is this choice to go into occupations that have less expensive temporal flexibility, that allow individuals to do their work on their own time.**  >> GOLDIN: By and large, it appears that there’s just a very high cost of temporal flexibility in certain occupations. And part of this is that people don’t have good substitutes for themselves in certain cases.  So, you are doing a merger in an acquisition, you’re a lawyer, you are a consultant — whatever it is — the client might say, “I want you there. I want you there all the time.  I want to call you at 2 in the morning. I want you to be there on Sunday, on holidays. I want you to go to Japan whenever I say that you should.”  Well, that’s a tremendous demand. So an individual who values their family time would say, “I’m not doing that.” So therefore if a woman wants to — law, for example, is a good example — if a woman wants to practice law, she has a law degree, she enjoys practicing law, being a corporate counsel would give her more flexibility. That doesn’t mean that she’s working fewer hours than she would’ve worked otherwise, but she can work her hours, and she gets paid somewhat less.

You realize women dominate the education system, and are over 60% of the college population with a massive degree in their favor, correct?  Women are a majority in 7/11 doctoral fields.  I can point to literal systemic sexism in the education system against men, a grading bias against boys even.  https://www.aei.org/publication/women-earned-majority-of-doctoral-degrees-in-2014-for-6th-straight-year-and-outnumber-men-in-grad-school-136-to-100/  >> Here’s my prediction – the facts that: a) men are underrepresented in graduate school enrollment overall (100 men were enrolled in 2014 for every 136.4 women), b) men received fewer master’s (41% of the total) and doctoral degrees (47.8% of the total) than women in 2014, and c) men were underrepresented in 7 out of 11 graduate fields of study at both the master’s and doctoral levels last year will get no attention at all from feminists, gender activists, women’s centers, the media, universities, and anybody in the higher education industry.  >> Additionally, there will be no calls for government studies, or increased government funding to address the significant gender disparities favoring women in graduate schools, and nobody will refer to the gender graduate school enrollment and degree gaps favoring women as a problem or a “crisis.” Further, neither President Obama nor Congress will address the gender graduate enrollment and degree gaps favoring women by invoking the Title IX gender-equity law, like they have threatened to do for the gender gap in some college math and science programs. And there won’t be any executive orders to address the significant under-representation of men in graduate schools by creating a White House Council on Boys and Men like the executive order issued by President Obama in 2009 to create the “White House Council on Women and Girls.” Finally, despite their stated commitment to “gender equity,” the hundreds of university women’s centers around the country are unlikely to show any concern about the significant gender inequities in graduate school enrollment and degrees, and universities will not be allocating funding to set up men’s centers on college campuses or providing funding for graduate scholarships for men.  >> Bottom Line: If there is any attention about gender differences in the CGS annual report, it will likely be about the fact that women are a minority in 4 of the 11 fields of graduate study including engineering and computer science (a gender gap which some consider to be a “national crisis”), with calls for greater awareness of female under-representation in STEM graduate fields of study and careers (except for the STEM field of biology, where women are over-represented). But don’t expect any concern about the fact that men have increasingly become the second sex in higher education. The concern about gender imbalances will remain extremely selective, and will only focus on cases when women, not men, are underrepresented and in the minority.","False","0","politics","pizzashill","2","t3_5pgtb7","0","null","null","1486260681","t5_2cneq"

This is like when white nationalists say ,MORE WHITE PEOPLE ARE THE VICTIMS OF CRIME FROM BLACK PEOPLE THAN VICE VERSA, to explain away systemic racism.  >> women are less likely to earn tenure  http://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360.abstract  >> National randomized experiments and validation studies were conducted on 873 tenure-track faculty (439 male, 434 female) from biology, engineering, economics, and psychology at 371 universities/colleges from 50 US states and the District of Columbia. In the main experiment, 363 faculty members evaluated narrative summaries describing hypothetical female and male applicants for tenure-track assistant professorships who shared the same lifestyle (e.g., single without children, married with children). Applicants' profiles were systematically varied to disguise identically rated scholarship; profiles were counterbalanced by gender across faculty to enable between-faculty comparisons of hiring preferences for identically qualified women versus men. Results revealed a 2:1 preference for women by faculty of both genders across both math-intensive and non–math-intensive fields, with the single exception of male economists, who showed no gender preference. Results were replicated using weighted analyses to control for national sample characteristics. In follow-up experiments, 144 faculty evaluated competing applicants with differing lifestyles (e.g., divorced mother vs. married father), and 204 faculty compared same-gender candidates with children, but differing in whether they took 1-y-parental leaves in graduate school. Women preferred divorced mothers to married fathers; men preferred mothers who took leaves to mothers who did not. In two validation studies, 35 engineering faculty provided rankings using full curricula vitae instead of narratives, and 127 faculty rated one applicant rather than choosing from a mixed-gender group; the same preference for women was shown by faculty of both genders. These results suggest it is a propitious time for women launching careers in academic science. Messages to the contrary may discourage women from applying for STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) tenure-track assistant professorships.   Seriously?     >> Except women are a social minority, and are clearly disadvantaged when compared to men.  BASED ON WHAT, LOL. Literally every social metric women win.  - They're more likely to be educated.  - Less likely to be the victims of violent crime.  - Men are 80% of the homeless population.  - men kill themselves at a 4-1 ratio.  - their issues are paid attention unlike men.  - Men are 97% of work related deaths.

I think a mix of both is best, people with the money should be able to buy expedited services.  Your wait times are not longer, is the thing. In Canada you might ration care by wait times, but in the US we ration it on ability to afford that care.  That's why the wait times look shorter here, at any given time there are thousands if not millions of people not going to the doctor because they can't afford it.  This keeps wait times ,down.,   That being said, the wait times are not due to single payer, but the fact Canada doesn't want to spend more on it, they could spend more and greatly reduce/remove wait times.  >> Yup, many of them deny it.

While the achievement is widely recognized, it is still largely unexplored why China was able to attain it within a short period. This study aims to fill the gap. Through a systematic political and socio-economic analysis, it identifies seven major drivers for China's success, including (1) the SARS outbreak as a wake-up call, (2) strong public support for government intervention in health care, (3) renewed political commitment from top leaders, (4) heavy government subsidies, (5) fiscal capacity backed by China's economic power, (6) financial and political responsibilities delegated to local governments and (7) programmatic implementation strategy. Three of the factors seem to be unique to China (i.e., the SARS outbreak, the delegation, and the programmatic strategy.) while the other factors are commonly found in other countries’ insurance expansion experiences. This study also discusses challenges and recommendations for China's health financing, such as reducing financial risk as an immediate task, equalizing benefit across insurance programs as a long-term goal, improving quality by tying provider payment to performance, and controlling costs through coordinated reform initiatives.

Brower of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal and Sadie Blanchard of Yale Law School published an article in the Columbia Journal of Transnational law outlining various common myths regarding ISDS. They assert that the balance of power created by international arbitration mechanisms is not nearly as asymmetric as its opponents would allege. They found that tribunals under the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) have ruled in favour of investors in 46% of cases and have typically granted less than 40% of the damages initially sought. This does not indicate any form of systemic bias in favour of investors in international arbitration courts.  >> Additionally, governments possess a wide variety of tools to sanction breaches by investors. Aside from civil damages, governments may also seek criminal sanctions in their own courts. Expropriation of assets may also serve as an enforcement tool for wronged governments. Conversely, in developing countries with politicized judicial systems, arbitration tribunals established by trade agreements often serve as investors’ only recourse in recovering damages from governments.  >> Brower and Blanchard deconstruct allegations of ISDS eroding national sovereignty by pointing out that limiting the scope of legitimate state action is precisely the purpose of international treaties. Criticisms of this type made with respect to ISDS may be equally applied to all international conventions that include enforcement mechanisms, without which they are effectively toothless. Concerns regarding the content that is being enforced may be entirely valid. However, the mere presence of an enforcement mechanism should not be viewed as a point against the TPP.  >> The authors of the article also state that ISDS is highly unlikely to interfere with the imposition of environmental regulations that reduce the return on certain investments. Not a single environmental regulation has been struck down via ISDS as of the time of writing, and no damages have been awarded to investors pursuant to a claim regarding the enforcement of an environmental law.  >> Claims that ISDS leads to “regulatory chill,” where governments are dissuaded from enacting environmental legislation out of concern for litigation in ISDS tribunals, are equally unfounded. To successfully claim damages from a state party, plaintiffs must show that the measure was “pretextual, discriminatory, or lacking in due process.” They must demonstrate that the supposed environmental law in fact targeted them unfairly, either by not similarly binding domestic investors or by blatantly serving as a pretext for favouring domestic industry. Given that no ISDS claim concerning environmental regulation has succeeded to date, it is exceedingly unlikely that investors will be willing to face the steep costs of arbitration in hopes of an improbable victory.  >> Investor-state dispute resolution has become a standard feature of international trade, benefitting both investors, who are assured of fair treatment in arbitration courts, and developing countries, which benefit from increased levels of foreign investment and an effective subsidy for their judicial systems. Provisions in the TPP establishing such a framework are not unusual in the extent to which they bind governments. Rather, they provide the possibility of enforcement of the landmark trade agreement. While certain groups may have other legitimate grievances regarding the TPP, the inclusion of an ISDS mechanism is in the interest of all parties involved.

LOL.  https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/upshot/the-problem-with-gop-plans-to-sell-health-insurance-across-state-lines.html  >> In 2012, Ms. Corlette and co-authors completed a study of a number of states that passed laws to allow out-of-state insurance sales. Not a single out-of-state insurer had taken them up on the offer. As Ms. Corlette’s paper highlighted, there is no federal impediment to across-state-lines arrangements. The main difficulty is that most states want to regulate local products themselves. The Affordable Care Act actually has a few provisions to encourage more regional and national sales of insurance, but they have not proved popular.  >> Insurers have been muted in their enthusiasm for G.O.P. across-state-lines plans. Neither America’s Health Insurance Plans, the lobbying group for most private insurers, nor the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association have endorsed such a plan when it has come before Congress.  >> There’s a part of the health insurance market where regulations are largely identical around the country: the one for private Medicare Advantage plans. If uniform rules alone could ensure a broad array of competitors, you might expect to see many insurers participating. But that does not seem to be the case.  >> A recent report found that, in 97 percent of counties, the market for Medicare Advantage plans was “highly concentrated,” meaning very limited choices.  >> Beyond regulations and doctors, demographics help explain why insurance is cheaper in some places than others. Insurance tends to be less expensive in states like Utah and Colorado, where more people are young and healthy. If customers in New York wanted to start buying Utah plans, they might face two surprises: fewer local doctors and higher costs related to the health of the local population.  >> “I’ve tried for 10 years to explain this to Republicans; it is a big problem,” said Merrill Matthews, a resident scholar at the Institute for Policy Innovation, which focuses on free-market solutions to policy problems. “Just because a good affordable policy is available in another state doesn’t mean that I would be able to get the network of physicians and the good prices that are available in that other state.”  >> Critics of the across-state-lines plan worry about negative consequences of letting insurers shop for the state regulator of their choice. Just as many businesses tend to incorporate in Delaware, or credit card companies have headquarters in South Dakota, insurers may end up congregating in whatever state offers the most lenient regulations. That could mean that customers who get sick could be harmed because there are few comprehensive policies available, or because consumer protections are weak when things go wrong.  >> Right now, the Affordable Care Act sets up some minimum standards for insurance plans sold everywhere, but since the Republican proposals include repealing the law, those limitations would presumably disappear.  >> There’s one other problem with Mr. Trump’s statement: The across-state-lines issue affects only individuals and small businesses, and rarely matters for large companies like his Trump Organization. His campaign wouldn’t confirm the company’s insurance arrangement, but nearly every large American company is what’s called self-insured. That means it is not subject to state insurance regulation.  >> Truly national health insurance companies are still rare, in part because building a national provider network is so difficult. The limited choices Mr. Trump faced were most likely those of the national market and not the result of varying state regulation.

In general and primary elections alone, more than 1 billion ballots were cast in that period.”  1  >> In 2012, a team of students led by the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University analyzed 2,068 alleged election-fraud cases since 2000 and concluded that “while fraud has occurred, the rate is infinitesimal, and in-person voter impersonation on Election Day, which prompted 37 state legislatures to enact or consider tough voter ID laws, is virtually non-existent.”  2  >> In October 2002, the Justice Department in the George W. Bush administration introduced the Ballot Access and Voting Integrity Initiative, which was charged, in part, with targeting voter fraud.

It is far, far, far easier to steal an election by bribing an election official or mail-in/absentee voting. Unsurprisingly, all the evidence of serious fraud concerns the latter sort.”  >> And Nathaniel Persily, a professor of law at Stanford University who worked on a bipartisan presidential commission formed after the 2012 election to address the issue of long lines at polling places, told us, “There is very little voter fraud.

To evaluate these arguments, we analyze recent trade data and survey post-NAFTA studies. We find that both the U.S. and Mexico benefit from NAFTA, with much larger relative benefits for Mexico. NAFTA also has had little effect on the U.S. labor market. These results confirm the consensus opinion of economists at the time of the debate. Finally, studies find that trade creation greatly exceeds trade diversion in the region under NAFTA, especially in intermediate goods.

We also propose a new method to estimate sectoral trade elasticities consistent with any trade model that delivers a multiplicative gravity equation. We apply our model and use our estimated elasticities to identify the impact of NAFTA's tariff reductions. We find that Mexico's welfare increases by 1.31%, U.S.'s welfare increases by 0.08%, and Canada's welfare declines by 0.06%. We find that intra-bloc trade increases by 118% for Mexico, 11% for Canada and 41% for the U.S. We show that welfare effects from tariff reductions are reduced when the structure of production does not take into account intermediate goods or input-output linkages. Our results highlight the importance of sectoral heterogeneity, intermediate goods and sectoral linkages for the quantification of the welfare gains from tariffs reductions.**   Not only that, but your argument makes no logical sense.  http://bigstory.ap.org/article/265cd8fb02fb44a69cf0eaa2063e11d9/mexico-taking-us-factory-jobs-blame-robots-instead  >> But research shows that the automation of U.S. factories is a much bigger factor than foreign trade in the loss of factory jobs.

Fraud almost never takes place through in-person voting (and certainly not enough to swing an election),” Heather Gerken, a professor of law at Yale Law School and an election law expert, told us via email.  >> Gerken, who was a senior legal adviser to the Obama campaigns in 2008 and 2012, added, “There have been astonishingly few examples, and with good reason. It is far, far, far easier to steal an election by bribing an election official or mail-in/absentee voting. Unsurprisingly, all the evidence of serious fraud concerns the latter sort.”  >> And Nathaniel Persily, a professor of law at Stanford University who worked on a bipartisan presidential commission formed after the 2012 election to address the issue of long lines at polling places, told us, “There is very little voter fraud. There is virtually no voter impersonation fraud. Where there is fraud it is usually done at the wholesale rather than retail level — usually with absentee or mail ballots.”   ","False","0","politics","pizzashill","3","t3_5qbu48","0","null","null","1486460501","t5_2cneq"

This post is not intended to make a specific claim on my part concerning how many non-citizens voted in 2016. It has a much narrower aim. My goal was to show that an extrapolation from my coauthored work on the 2008 election to the 2016 election did not support the arguments some seemed to be making that the entire popular vote margin for Clinton was due to illegal votes by non-citizens. In this post I do my own calculation of that extrapolation for the purpose of demonstrating that this extrapolation would not support that claim. There are a number of reasons why one should be cautious about extrapolating from the 2008 CCES data to 2016. Many things can and have changed over the course of eight years. For example, a number of states have made efforts to use matching of records to remove non-citizen registrants from voter rolls. For example, on this blog I have recently highlighted data from Virginia and North Carolina concerning such matching efforts. These non-citizens are no longer on voter rolls. There are other states that have been even more aggressive about the issue of attempting to verify that registered voters are citizens. Furthermore, although the evidence from our 2014 paper suggests that it is only partially effective, many states have moved to adopt tighter identification requirements. The 2008 estimate is inherently uncertain. It depends upon a number of assumptions including assumptions about the validity of the survey data. Our critics have made a variety of arguments and I encourage readers to evaluate those arguments along with our responses to them. In the absence of other data, arguably an extrapolation from the earlier (2008) numbers is the best one can do.

The EPA, for example, which Trump is trying to gut currently returns about 30 dollars for every dollar spent I believe in health benefits.  Not only that, we're currently in a green energy arms race with China, they'll win if Trump gets his way, and with that, the US will no longer be a superpower.

Any equality movement would be about actual equality, not making up statistics and pushing a false narrative that women are oppressed, no matter how overwhelming the empirical data is that they aren't.   >> It's a good argument. In the case of domestic violence the last thing you want is equal time-share.  Do you not know what the word ,premise, means? They start at 50-50, and then the court would decide if that needs to not be the case, that's what the bill did.  It didn't promise 50-50 custody.  >> Now Warren Ferral is obviously not Hitler.

However, keep in mind that would I stated was a feminist view of Warren Farrell. I, in fact, gave a very rational argument as to why we would protest him. Your claim is that the protest was irrational and had no basis behind this. As much as you disagree with my reasoning, it is a rational one, and your argument that the protest was irrational is wrong.

The recovery of Aristotle's texts is considered a major period in mediaeval philosophy, leading to Aristotelianism.[1][2][3] Because some of Aristotle's newly translated views discounted the notions of a personal God, immortal soul, or creation, various leaders of the Catholic Church were inclined to censor those views for decades,[1] such as lists of forbidden books in the Condemnations of 1210–1277 at the University of Paris. Meanwhile, Thomas Aquinas (c.1225–1274), at the end of that time period, was able to reconcile the viewpoints of Aristotelianism and Christianity, primarily in his work, Summa Theologica (1265–1274).[1]  >> The rejection, by powerful religious leaders, to censor some recovered books of Aristotle, opened a new path to allow other ideas to be considered, or taught, regarding subjects in the banned books. Eventually, new ideas became more widespread, such as the heliocentric (sun-centered) system noted by Galileo Galilei (1564–1642), which rejected Aristotle's Earth-centered system, even though Galileo's ideas were later censored by Church officials during his lifetime, as well.

Fifteen delegates made statements about the power of the federal courts to review the constitutionality of laws, with all but two of them supporting the idea.[17]  >> Likewise, at the state ratifying conventions, over two dozen delegates in at least seven states indicated that under the Constitution, the federal courts would have the power to declare statutes unconstitutional.[18] Professors Saikrishna Prakash and John Yoo point out, with respect to the ratification of the Constitution, that ,no scholar to date has identified even one participant in the ratification fight who argued that the Constitution did not authorize judicial review of Federal statutes. This silence in the face of the numerous comments on the other side is revealing.,[19]  >> The concept of judicial review was discussed in The Federalist Papers. Alexander Hamilton asserted in Federalist No. 78 that under the Constitution, the federal courts would have not just the power, but the duty, to examine the constitutionality of statutes:  >> **The courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges as, a fundamental law. It, therefore, belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body.

It's operating on a lot of flawed assumptions with conflicting evidence.  >> Formal equality is about equal opportunities to participate, and to make the choices that affect your life. Real equality is about equal distribution of participation, resources, power and responsibilities.  Right here? This is absurd, it seems to think that men and women are exactly the same in every way and if something isn't 50-50 it's because of sexism.  We know for a fact there are biological differences between men and women that aren't simply the result of how we socialize boys and girls.  For example, we know baby boys are more interested in mechanical objects than baby girls are.   http://www.math.kth.se/matstat/gru/godis/sex.pdf  Here's a study on that. Equality of opportunity is what we need to aim for, and we absolutely have equality of opportunity. This is one of the major beefs I have with modern 3rd wave feminism, they seem to think they can just throw out biology and assume there are no differences between males and females, that's just.. absurd.  >> Culture and tradition are important to Norwegian women. Traditional activities such as knitting, sewing, crocheting, cooking, are building blocks of our identity. We pride ourselves in practicing and perpetuating the traditions that belong to the homemaker. ,Rose, blogs have thousands of followers in Norway, mainly among the younger generation. Most Norwegian women value these aspects of life in line with our professional life.  Oh no, we can't have people doing what they enjoy, we can't have that at all! Seriously, does this person think women are oppressed in Norway or something? The author is literally angry because people are doing things they value, because those things don't fall in line with his/her worldview.  >> Fathers are allotted 10 weeks of parental leave. This is to strengthen the fathers' relationships with their children and to signal the need for fathers to participate in childcare -- 68 per cent of fathers take their full quota or more. Women take the most the parental leave; the full period is 49 weeks with full pay. For many women, the stay at home is longer. The government offers a cash-for-care benefit to parents who decline public day care facilities until the child is two years old. More women choose this route. In 2011, 84 per cent of those receiving the benefit were women (Ellingsæter 2012). This means that some women have been out of the workforce for 2 years, while men have only been out for 10 weeks.   Holy shit, again, what is wrong with this person? The country gives them an absurd amount of leave, while they're being paid, and offers free child care to them. **Women are making the choice to stay at home longer, this system is beyond generous.**  So we see the author again, complaining that women are making choices he/she doesn't like. Even when women are offered free child care, 49 weeks of leave with pay, they still find a way to complain.  >> The entry of women into positions of power and decision-making in society is important for the development of a democratic and egalitarian society. Most political parties have introduced gender quotas. In the 2013 national election, women gained 39.6 per cent of the seats in the parliament. In local government, women occupy about one third of the seats. Women's labour market participation in Norway is among the highest in Europe. However, women still earn 86 per cent of a man's wage. Women make up 71 percent of the public sector and 34 per cent of women work part-time, compared to 14 percent men. Despite working part-time, the share of women working outside regular hours has gradually decreased in the last seven years. Work hours are upheld and respected; most employees can, if they choose to, leave their work place at 4 o'clock sharp. This makes it possible for mothers and fathers to pick up children in kindergartens and attend their needs for activities and other support in the afternoon.   And yet again, we see this person trying to paint something good as a negative. Complaining because women aren't making the choices he/she likes. A bonus wage gap myth being thrown in there too.  Women make less because they overwhelmingly go into lower paying fields and work less hours, they aren't literally being paid less for the same work. And again, as seen above, Norway offers them free child care and leave with pay, they have no excuse here, they could easily go back to work if they wanted. Does it not occur to this person that maybe men and women are just different?   >> Gender equality and the welfare state are mutually inclusive -- the welfare state is a precondition for gender equality and gender equality is necessary to develop and maintain the welfare state. Yet, Norway continues to face challenges to achieve ,real, gender equality.   No, they've achieved equality, that equality just doesn't line up with your trash view that everything has to be 50-50 and men are women are the exact same.  I had to stop reading here, this person is delusional. Here's a good doc on gender equality in Norway:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5LRdW8xw70  Funny how even in the most equal countries on the planet with beyond generous systems in place feminists still find a way to cry oppression.

Academic research does not provide much support for this claim. The evidence suggests that when immigration increases the supply of labor, firms increase investment to offset any reduction in capital per worker, thereby keeping average wages from falling over the long term. Moreover, immigrants are often imperfect substitutes for native-born workers in U.S. labor markets. That means they do not compete for the same jobs and put minimal downward pressure on natives’ wages. This might explain why competition from new immigrants has mostly affected earlier immigrants, who experienced significant reductions in wages from the surge in immigration. In contrast, studies find that immigration has actually raised average wages of native-born workers during the last few decades.  >> Immigrants are at the forefront of innovation and ingenuity in the United States, accounting for a disproportionately high share of patent filings, science and technology graduates, and senior positions at top venture capital-funded firms. In addition, the presence of immigrants often creates opportunities for less-skilled native workers to become more specialized in their work, thereby increasing their productivity.  >> Immigration generally also improves the government’s fiscal situation, as many immigrants pay more in taxes over a lifetime than they consume in government services. However, native-born residents of states with large concentrations of less-educated immigrants may face larger tax burdens, as these immigrants pay less in taxes and are more likely to send children to public schools.  >> A popular view is that immigrants are taking jobs from American citizens. However, although immigrants increase the supply of labor, they also spend their wages on homes, food, TVs and other goods and services and expand domestic economic demand. This increased demand, in turn, generates more jobs to build those homes, make and sell food, and transport TVs.  >> Most empirical studies indicate long-term benefits for natives’ employment and wages from immigration, although some studies suggest that these gains come at the cost of short-term losses from lower wages and higher unemployment. Standard economic theory implies that while higher labor supply from immigration may initially depress wages, over time firms increase investment to restore the amount of capital per worker, which then restores wages. Steady growth in the capital-labor ratio prevents workers’ average productivity, and therefore their average wages from declining over the long run. Figure 2 shows the pre-1980 trend in the capital-labor ratio extrapolated over the next few decades – the period when U.S. immigration accelerated. Consistent with the theory, the actual capital-labor ratio did not significantly or permanently deviate from that trend after 1980.","False","0","politics","pizzashill","6","t3_5r0y4y","0","null","null","1486557844","t5_2cneq"

I suspect you're aware of the narrative that we have a crisis for women in education because they're a minority in 4 STEM fields, right? It's all anyone talks about, but did you know women are a majority in the other 7 doctoral fields and overall 60% of the college population?  When's the last time you heard the government bring that up?  http://www.aei.org/publication/stunning-college-degree-gap-women-have-earned-almost-10-million-more-college-degrees-than-men-since-1982/  https://www.aei.org/publication/women-earned-majority-of-doctoral-degrees-in-2014-for-6th-straight-year-and-outnumber-men-in-grad-school-136-to-100/  The second actually sums it up.  >>  Here’s my prediction – the facts that: a) men are underrepresented in graduate school enrollment overall (100 men were enrolled in 2014 for every 136.4 women), b) men received fewer master’s (41% of the total) and doctoral degrees (47.8% of the total) than women in 2014, and c) men were underrepresented in 7 out of 11 graduate fields of study at both the master’s and doctoral levels last year will get no attention at all from feminists, gender activists, women’s centers, the media, universities, and anybody in the higher education industry.  >> Additionally, there will be no calls for government studies, or increased government funding to address the significant gender disparities favoring women in graduate schools, and nobody will refer to the gender graduate school enrollment and degree gaps favoring women as a problem or a “crisis.” Further, neither President Obama nor Congress will address the gender graduate enrollment and degree gaps favoring women by invoking the Title IX gender-equity law, like they have threatened to do for the gender gap in some college math and science programs. And there won’t be any executive orders to address the significant under-representation of men in graduate schools by creating a White House Council on Boys and Men like the executive order issued by President Obama in 2009 to create the “White House Council on Women and Girls.” Finally, despite their stated commitment to “gender equity,” the hundreds of university women’s centers around the country are unlikely to show any concern about the significant gender inequities in graduate school enrollment and degrees, and universities will not be allocating funding to set up men’s centers on college campuses or providing funding for graduate scholarships for men.  >> Bottom Line: If there is any attention about gender differences in the CGS annual report, it will likely be about the fact that women are a minority in 4 of the 11 fields of graduate study including engineering and computer science (a gender gap which some consider to be a “national crisis”), with calls for greater awareness of female under-representation in STEM graduate fields of study and careers (except for the STEM field of biology, where women are over-represented). But don’t expect any concern about the fact that men have increasingly become the second sex in higher education. The concern about gender imbalances will remain extremely selective, and will only focus on cases when women, not men, are underrepresented and in the minority.

As I write, the number one video cassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. Beavis and Butthead remains popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.

We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.  >> Avoidable human misery is more often caused not so much by stupidity as by ignorance, particularly our ignorance about ourselves.
