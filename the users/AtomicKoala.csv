It found that the export ban effectively discriminated against U.S. PCB waste disposal companies, in favour of Canadian PCB waste disposal companies, thereby breaching NAFTA’s national treatment obligation. The Tribunal’s decision was based on its view that the primary purpose of the ban was to protect the interests of the Canadian waste disposal industry and not environmental protection. The Tribunal, by a majority, also found that, on the facts of the case, the breach of Article 1102 essentially established a breach of the minimum standard of treatment guaranteed by Article 1105. Mr. Chiasson disagreed and found that SDMI had not established a breach of Article 1105.  >In its second partial award of October 21, 2002, the Tribunal found that compensation should be awarded to SDMI for the overall economic losses it sustained as a proximate result of Canada’s measure, whether they were sustained in Canada or in the U.S.  The Tribunal awarded damages to SDMI in the amount of $6,050,000 CAD plus interest. It also awarded costs to SDMI in the amount of $850,000 CAD plus interest.  >#Review by the Federal Court  >Canada sought judicial review of the Tribunal’s award before the Federal Court of Canada on the ground that the award exceeded the scope of the submission to arbitration and contravened the public policy of Canada.

"7","AtomicKoala","ireland","False","0","I'd rather we try to keep them out of Europe by:  a) Enforcing international law so the likes of Assad have to fight to protect their civilians, not protect the regime by leveling their own cities.  b) When this fails, provide for safe zones in such countries.  c) When this is of limited use, provide funding for refugee provision in neighboring countries.  d) When this begins to overflow, maintain extraterritorial centres for processing and short to medium term holding of asylum seekers to be vetted, and permanent holding of those who can't be vetted or should be deported.   Europe did shit all regarding part a) in Syria (despite doing something in Libya at least), did nothing regarding b) unlike the 90s (Iraqi Kurdistan), c) is chronically underfunded (meaning we spend more at home), and d) doesn't exist at all.  In all fairness a lot of asylum seekers (from more westernised countries like Venezuela) might integrate fine, but either way we have high unemployment so we need minimal immigration and our motivations should be humanitarian.
