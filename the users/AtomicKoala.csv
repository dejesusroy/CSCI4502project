The Tribunals decision was based on its view that the primary purpose of the ban was to protect the interests of the Canadian waste disposal industry and not environmental protection. The Tribunal, by a majority, also found that, on the facts of the case, the breach of Article 1102 essentially established a breach of the minimum standard of treatment guaranteed by Article 1105. Mr. Chiasson disagreed and found that SDMI had not established a breach of Article 1105.  >In its second partial award of October 21, 2002, the Tribunal found that compensation should be awarded to SDMI for the overall economic losses it sustained as a proximate result of Canadas measure, whether they were sustained in Canada or in the U.S.  The Tribunal awarded damages to SDMI in the amount of $6,050,000 CAD plus interest.
