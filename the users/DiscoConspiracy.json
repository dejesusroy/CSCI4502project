Our infrastructure is also, ironically here, one of the things Trump has been very vocal about improving.\n\nSorry, I wasn't sure how else to term it.  Not infrastructure in the sense of roads and things.  I know he wants to improve that, and I agree.  It needs to be done.\n\nSince it might help putting this comment in context:\n\n&gt;What does the U.S. have that developing nations don't?\n\nWhen I say infrastructure, I mean some of the internal infrastructure that is not tangible.  Our institutions, even some regulatory agencies--things like that.  If a foreign actor that does not have the U.S.'s interests in heart can do away with those, then we get screwed.  Corruption, however bad it might already be now, could become more rampant.  Our system weakens.\n\nFor instance, the SEC provides filed financial statements at no individual charge on their web site.  This makes it easy for ANYONE to pull data from it and make the necessary calculations to try to increase their or their investors' wealth.  It provides information to help people make decisions.  In our modern day world of technology, these documents can be run through software to provide all sorts of data and analysis.\n\nTake it away or cripple it, then I think America becomes less great.  It's just that it's the kind of thing that you can't really see with your eyes.  It's abstract, but it could very well be just one grease and cog in our system that keeps everything running well--whatever it's flaws.\n\nOr take the varied types of business entities that we have.  Wouldn't it be nice, from a foreign actor's standpoint that will not do business within our borders, if those just went away? If it could be made more difficult to do business in the U.S.  Yet another part of our infrastructure that makes America great goes away.  How easy is it for someone to come along and say they want to \"Simplify and consolidate\" all that? Who couldn't get behind the idea, in theory?\n\nOr how about removing the option for businesses to easily declare bankruptcy? Or to provide some consequence to people that own certain types of businesses who declare bankruptcy? Less people will be interested in starting a business.  Our system and society weakens.  But yet, it would be easy to say that we are tired of \"deadbeat\" businesses stealing our tax dollars or being a burden unto society.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying this is absolutely what is going to happen.

I remember a lot of definite probably Iranian actual government shills making posts.\n\nI don't know how much stock people give to foreign actors creating shill accounts to flood the Internet, but I believe IRI and Russian government definitely have learned from each other.\n\nIs there a solution to this puzzle? I don't know.  Maybe mods can be trained to spot actual shills and government operatives, through examination of how sentences are worded, etc.  Seems maybe a little bit severe, and it could cut off a way to interact with foreign government actors directly, but maybe it's doable.","retrieved_on":1486034024,"subreddit_id":"t5_2xinb","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_5nr97r","created_utc":1484363511,"distinguished":null,"parent_id":"t1_dce6lkn","id":"dcekeis","edited":false}{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","retrieved_on":1486034059,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_5nk66p","score":1,"author":"DiscoConspiracy","subreddit":"worldnews","gilded":0,"stickied":false,"body":"So Russia and Israel aren't friends or partners, as the Wikipedia article seems to suggest?
