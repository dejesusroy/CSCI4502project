Since it might help putting this comment in context:  >What does the U.S. have that developing nations don't?  When I say infrastructure, I mean some of the internal infrastructure that is not tangible.  Our institutions, even some regulatory agencies--things like that.  If a foreign actor that does not have the U.S.'s interests in heart can do away with those, then we get screwed.  Corruption, however bad it might already be now, could become more rampant.  Our system weakens.  For instance, the SEC provides filed financial statements at no individual charge on their web site.  This makes it easy for ANYONE to pull data from it and make the necessary calculations to try to increase their or their investors' wealth.  It provides information to help people make decisions.  In our modern day world of technology, these documents can be run through software to provide all sorts of data and analysis.  Take it away or cripple it, then I think America becomes less great.  It's just that it's the kind of thing that you can't really see with your eyes.  It's abstract, but it could very well be just one grease and cog in our system that keeps everything running well--whatever it's flaws.  Or take the varied types of business entities that we have.

If it could be made more difficult to do business in the U.S.  Yet another part of our infrastructure that makes America great goes away.  How easy is it for someone to come along and say they want to ""Simplify and consolidate"" all that? Who couldn't get behind the idea, in theory?  Or how about removing the option for businesses to easily declare bankruptcy? Or to provide some consequence to people that own certain types of businesses who declare bankruptcy? Less people will be interested in starting a business.  Our system and society weakens.
