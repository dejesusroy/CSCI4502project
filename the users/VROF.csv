Technically, the baby was healthy and the mother was healthy, so to induce labor would be an abortion, and to do it at this stage in the pregnancy would be illegal.  >When Taylor started bleeding, they went back to the hospital, but with Fox’s heart still beating, doctors couldn’t legally interfere.  >""Eventually she was just screaming at them to get the child out of her,” Daniel said.  >After four days in and out of the hospital, the bag of waters surrounding their baby burst and Taylor delivered Fox. “One nice thing is we got to hold him,” Daniel said. “That’s the only silver lining.”  And instead of learning from this terrible legislative mistake, Ohio adopted it.

Bodily autonomy means a person has control over who or what uses their body, for what, and for how long. It’s why you can’t be forced to donate blood, tissue, or organs. Even if you’re dead. Even if you’d save or improve 20 lives. It’s why someone can’t touch you, have sex with you,or use your body in any way without your continuous consent.  A fetus is using someone’s body parts. Therefore under bodily autonomy, it is there by permission, not by right. It needs a person’s continuous consent. If they deny or withdraw consent, the pregnant person has a right to remove them from that moment. A fetus is equal in this regard because if I need someone else’s body parts to live, they also can legally deny me their use.   By saying a fetus has a right to someone’s body parts until it’s born, despite the pregnant person’s wishes, you’re doing two things.   1) Granting a fetus more rights to other people’s bodies than any born person. 2) Awarding a pregnant person less right’s to their body than a corpse.

Compare that to CSU, Long Beach (both of these schools give scholarships to National Merit Scholars) it costs aroun $7,000 to go there and the campus only has 32,000 students. There are many CSU campuses to choose from in California.   University of Arizona has around 42,000 students with tuition at $12,817 a year. University of California, Riverside tuition is $11,220 a year and there are 21,000 students there.   These costs don't factor financial aid, but I believe in California if families make less than $85,000 a year tuition to the UCs is free. We also have great financial aid for middle income students who attend CSUs and Community College.   The minimum wage in California is $10.50 and will be $15.00 by 2022. And that minimum wage is for everyone, including tipped positions.  I know a student who attends ASU and works at a chain restaurant.

I started giving my kids more and more freedoms when they got into junior high school and once they were in high school even more and by the time they could drive they had almost no rules. My kids never had a curfew; I just wanted to know where they were. It was made very clear that if they made the wrong choices those things would change. I had the luxury of living in a smallish and relatively safe city.   They loved their freedom so they didn't blow it. Now my kids are 18 and 20 and have traveled to many different countries without parents, and have taken numerous road trips in all different driving conditions. I was very unhappy about the ski trip in the snowstorm but everything worked out fine. When problems came up, they solved them.   Not giving kids freedom to roam a neighborhood where they are at risk of real harm isn't bad parenting. There are plenty of opportunities where kids can grow and experience life.

The cafeteria at most elementary schools I am in has a salad bar and most of the food seems pretty good.   How do you get rid of no-nonsense policy when administrators gather people in meetings and talk for an hour waiting for everyone to be on the same page instead of just saying how things will be?   I would rather see a wide range of topics in the curriculum instead of math and language arts all day long with little growth or progress.   Hard for me to see how we will determine the better pay for motivated teachers when that motivation isn't encouraged. Right now I am watching yet another school pander to teachers who like a program being piloted because it is ""easy."" Since when do we make things easier for teachers without showing progress for students?   Maybe I've been in education too long but I am seriously tired of the constant changes without any evidence that kids are doing better; and the lack of accountability for teachers who are just not doing their jobs.   This year at our school 4 classes of 4th graders showed up for the first day of school and not a single one of them knew to indent paragraphs. Most of them didn't even recognize the margin on the page. What did they do in 1st-3rd grade? And not one teacher was held accountable for literally failing to do their job last year.

Recently my time has been spent in underperforming Oakland charter schools. I have been a teacher, administrator, consultant, and parent volunteer. My kids attended public school and the youngest graduated from high school last year.   I would suggest parents explore homeschool options for high school and take advantage of K-12 concurrent enrollment with junior college (In California) that allows students to take up to 11 units for $39 a semester. Usually the homeschool charter high schools will purchase the textbooks. There is no bigger waste of a high school student's time than an AP or IB class.   I have watched elementary school change a lot over the last 15 years. The kindergarten my oldest child attended is not the same as the kindergarten at that school today. Time will tell if we see positive results from these changes but I would guess we won't. I've seen a lot of problems in schools over the years but they seem to be getting exponentially worse. And more money probably wouldn't solve them. In Oakland there is a desire to stop the ""pipeline to prison"" so suspensions are avoided. This sounds like a great idea until a 5th grader chokes the school psychologist and is back at school the next day. Or a 2nd grader takes his teacher's Macbook and throws it across the room because he was ""triggered."" (No consideration is given to the other 19 kids in the class who might find that behavior disturbing) So his idiotic IEP includes all kinds of things that make it easier for the teacher and the class; but ensure that this kid will not be educated when he leaves the school in 5th grade. That particular child is in 4th grade now and he is expected to produce no work. Any day he doesn't run out of class is seen as great for him.   I sat in a meeting this week where 4th grade teachers are going to divide the students and only teach one subject. This program is being piloted now with one teacher handling Language Arts and the other Math/Science. They have no data to support this move, but the teachers love it because it is ""easier.""   I used to believe that standardized testing was destroying public education. When my kids were in elementary school I opted them out. I still feel that it is harmful and the NCLB destroyed public education in the US. Unfortunately I also realize that if there isn't some kind of accountability, a large segment of our population will not be educated. There seems to be this constant kicking the can down the road and hoping for better later. So now the curriculum is pretty boring, there is very little enrichment, and teachers who aren't getting the job done are never, ever, EVER called out for it. Everyone pats each other on the back, hopes for better and just prays for the school year to end already. ","0","AskReddit","VROF","1"

Toast the cumin seeds in a small saute pan over med/low heat for 5-7 minutes or until you can easily smell the cumin. Remove the pan from the heat immediately if the seeds begin to smoke. Use a coffee bean grinder or spice grinder to grind the cumin until it is a fine powder.   2.  Add the water, chiles, and garlic to a blender and blend on high speed for 10-15 seconds or until the garlic and chiles are pureed. Add the other adobo ingredients, including the ground cumin, and blend just until combined--about 5 seconds.   3.  If you are preparing steak--and your steaks are on the thick side--slice the steak through the middle to make 2 thinner steaks. Add the chicken or steak to the marinade in a large bowl. Cover and chill for 16-24 hours.   4.  When you are ready to prepare your chicken or steak, preheat your bbq grill to high heat. You can also cook the chicken on an indoor grill pan on your stove over medium heat. Cook the chicken for 4-5 minutes per side or until done, and steak for 2-3 minutes per side, or until done.   5.  Allow the chicken or steak to sit for 3 minutes then dice. Use immediately to make burritos, tacos, bowls and salads.   ","0","MimicRecipes","VROF","1"
