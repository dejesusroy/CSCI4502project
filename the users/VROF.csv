Technically, the baby was healthy and the mother was healthy, so to induce labor would be an abortion, and to do it at this stage in the pregnancy would be illegal.  >When Taylor started bleeding, they went back to the hospital, but with Fox’s heart still beating, doctors couldn’t legally interfere.  >""Eventually she was just screaming at them to get the child out of her,” Daniel said.  >After four days in and out of the hospital, the bag of waters surrounding their baby burst and Taylor delivered Fox. “One nice thing is we got to hold him,” Daniel said. “That’s the only silver lining.”  And instead of learning from this terrible legislative mistake, Ohio adopted it.

Even if you’d save or improve 20 lives. It’s why someone can’t touch you, have sex with you,or use your body in any way without your continuous consent.  A fetus is using someone’s body parts.

A fetus is equal in this regard because if I need someone else’s body parts to live, they also can legally deny me their use.

Recently my time has been spent in underperforming Oakland charter schools. I have been a teacher, administrator, consultant, and parent volunteer. My kids attended public school and the youngest graduated from high school last year.   I would suggest parents explore homeschool options for high school and take advantage of K-12 concurrent enrollment with junior college (In California) that allows students to take up to 11 units for $39 a semester. Usually the homeschool charter high schools will purchase the textbooks. There is no bigger waste of a high school student's time than an AP or IB class.   I have watched elementary school change a lot over the last 15 years. The kindergarten my oldest child attended is not the same as the kindergarten at that school today. Time will tell if we see positive results from these changes but I would guess we won't. I've seen a lot of problems in schools over the years but they seem to be getting exponentially worse. And more money probably wouldn't solve them. In Oakland there is a desire to stop the ""pipeline to prison"" so suspensions are avoided. This sounds like a great idea until a 5th grader chokes the school psychologist and is back at school the next day. Or a 2nd grader takes his teacher's Macbook and throws it across the room because he was ""triggered."" (No consideration is given to the other 19 kids in the class who might find that behavior disturbing) So his idiotic IEP includes all kinds of things that make it easier for the teacher and the class; but ensure that this kid will not be educated when he leaves the school in 5th grade. That particular child is in 4th grade now and he is expected to produce no work. Any day he doesn't run out of class is seen as great for him.   I sat in a meeting this week where 4th grade teachers are going to divide the students and only teach one subject. This program is being piloted now with one teacher handling Language Arts and the other Math/Science. They have no data to support this move, but the teachers love it because it is ""easier.""   I used to believe that standardized testing was destroying public education. When my kids were in elementary school I opted them out. I still feel that it is harmful and the NCLB destroyed public education in the US. Unfortunately I also realize that if there isn't some kind of accountability, a large segment of our population will not be educated. There seems to be this constant kicking the can down the road and hoping for better later. So now the curriculum is pretty boring, there is very little enrichment, and teachers who aren't getting the job done are never, ever, EVER called out for it. Everyone pats each other on the back, hopes for better and just prays for the school year to end already. ",FALSE,0
