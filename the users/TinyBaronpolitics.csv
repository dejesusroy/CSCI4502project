In fact they made them easier to abuse by reformulation, compensated doctors for prescribing them, and fought any attempts to make them less addictive.    They should be removed from the market, period.  >The jump from pill addiction to heroin is almost entirely cost based. You could blame pharma and mostly over prescribing for the huge spike in opiate addiction over the last decade or so but people choosing heroin because it costs less is hardly their fault.   The cost of the oxycontin is set by the manufacturer.  Considering it is so cheap to manufacture, that is entirely the fault of the manufacturer.  These drugs shouldn't be prescribed anymore.

">I am a Trump supporter and think that the wall is extremely wasteful spending and of limited use. What needs to be done is to make it nearly impossible to work here without without legal status. Strict and heavy employer enforcement, extreme fines and even imprisonment for hiring any illegal worker. This entire issue would sort itself out real quickly.   I don't understand why you're a Trump supporter.  What you just said should make you quite the opposite.  Trump has never mentioned sanctioning employers as part of his strategy.  Instead it has always been demonization of the immigrants themselves, which I believe is unnecessary unless you are trying to exploit bigotry to win an election.  For me that disqualified him. Sanctioning employers would probably make the illegals go home of their own accord, but many of those employers are themselves Trump donors.

">For anyone who opposes this temporary immigration ban, take a good look at the case of Europe. Islamic terror was unheard of during the 1980s/90s...suddenly the floodgates open to middle eastern immigration, and slowly Islamic terror is becoming a way of life there.  But there was Communist Terror groups (Red Army, Baader Meinhof), Nationalist terror groups (Irish IRA, Basque ETA, OAS come to mind) and state terror groups.   They were overcome by working with the respective communities towards a political solution through peaceful means.    Not through arbitrary harassment of individuals simply because of their identity.  In fact, the groups arose precisely because of harrassment ( Irish Provisional IRA, Basque ETA).   Furthermore, there has been no ""flood"" of immigration before the refugee wave nor has terrorism become a ""way of life"" there.  Except in the fevered imaginations of far right agitators looking to win elections.  In a sense, they are working towards the same goals ISIS is.  http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/berlin-terror-attack-isis-terroism-aims-far-right-want-to-eliminate-countries-with-with-a7489931.html ","False","0","politics","TinyBaron","3","t3_5qodrj","null","0","null","t5_2cneq","1486510188","null","1485622110","dd0sxnd","1485625480","t1_dd0scvo"
