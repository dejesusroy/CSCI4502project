I hate to say it but by the first Super Tuesday it was over not sure how people don't get this, no ones came back from 200 delegates... \nI just don't think this is true I though superdelegates were unfair but in many ways so were caucases. \n\nI wish Biden had run because Clinton-Biden vote would be split and Sanders would have more of a chance. \n\nGuess what though most of the things you said were because of GOP they control everything. \n\nI would urge you to remember other people have different oppinions BUT young people's view of policies is rising up and soon are going to be mainstream. Once this generation dies money will be out of politics.. \n\nThe futures bright.
