"politics","He really has angered Europe. I don't get why he did that Bild interview, why he is planning on forcing an anti-European as our ambassador, why he supports secessionists when we're America's greatest ally.

China might even have to become an ally if Xi backs off from his authoritarianism and SCS seagrab.  How sad is this?

EDIT: For what it's worth, Tusk isn't the head of government as such (that would be President Juncker, President of the European Commission), but is President of the European Council, which is the council of heads of government of the member states, that gives the Union political direction. Juncker makes off the cuff statements all the time, but Tusk doesn't, that's not his role. His role is to organise the political direction of the Union and give voice to it. He would not be saying this if it didn't represent the view of at least a minority of national governments.
