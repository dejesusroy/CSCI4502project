I'm still confused who controlled the regestrations in the primaries it could be repubs purging independents and democrats from rolls. Take Ohio for example GOP purged 200,000 people from the rolls and than a million more before general . Most of those 200,000 people were students and people who never voted which would be Sanders supporters. So stuff like that could have happened. But that's Ohio corrupt as hell. I don't think Clinton would rig Alabama or Arkansas?  So yes they made disparaging emails but most of them were after Sanders had most likely lost the nomination. We never saw the emails from 2008. But you have to remember no ones ever come back from 200 delegates which was Clintons lead after the first supertuesday DNC rightfully or wrongly though Sanders was done until Michigan which then they treated it like a horse race but it wasn't.
