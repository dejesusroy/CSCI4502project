It\u2019s this:\n\n&gt;&gt; In 1966, Canada implemented a single-payer health care system, which is also known as Medicare. Since then, as a country, Canadians have made a conscious decision to hold down costs. One of the ways they do that is by limiting supply, mostly for elective things, which can create wait times. Their outcomes are otherwise comparable to ours.\n\n&gt;&gt; Please understand, the wait times could be overcome. Canadians could spend more. They don\u2019t want to. We can choose to dislike wait times in principle, but they are a byproduct of Canada\u2019s choice to be fiscally conservative.\n\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they chose this. In a rational world, those who are concerned about health care costs and what they mean to the economy might respect that course of action.

In 2008, the Democrats held a majority in the statehouse of 53-46. What RedMap does is they identify and target six specific statehouse seats. They spend $1 million on these races, which is an unheard of amount of money coming into a statehouse race. Republicans win five of these. They take control of the Statehouse in Ohio - also, the state Senate that year. And it gives them, essentially, a veto-proof run of the entire re-districting in the state.**\n\n&gt;&gt; **So in 2012, when Barack Obama wins again and he wins Ohio again, and Sherrod Brown is re-elected to the Senate by 325,000 votes, the Democrats get more votes in statehouse races than the Republicans. But the lines were drawn so perfectly that the Republicans held a 60-39 supermajority in the House of Representatives, despite having fewer votes.**\n\n\nThe people running the GOP aren't stupid, they aren't uneducated. Their base is, and they're better at manipulating that base.\n\n&gt;&gt; Gerrymandering doesn't account for the complete collapse of the party. Sorry but take a look again at the article I linked. The losses were not only in the house but also the senate as well as in state legislatures and governors. That's not gerrymandering. That's just getting your ass kicked.\n\n\nThe senate was never going to stay under dermocratic control, 17% of the country can elect a senate majority, the DNC wins the popular vote nationally in senate races.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; In conclusion, it appears that despite the superior intellect, education, and output the Democrats haven't yet figured out how to win elections so enjoy being ruled by a bunch of dumbass Republicans for the next 4-8 years.

Ricardo already knew better in 1817. An introductory economics course should drive home to students the point that international trade is not about competition, it is about mutually beneficial exchange. Even more fundamentally, we should be able to teach students that imports, not exports, are the purpose of trade. That is, what a country gains from trade is the ability to import things it wants. Exports are not an objective in and of themselves: the need to export is a burden that a country must bear because its import suppliers are crass enough to demand payment.**\n\n\n\nNot only that, we would probably end up **losing jobs** with the things Trump says.\n\n\nThe steel tariff fiasco is a good example of this.\n\n&gt;&gt; As a result of a Section 201 (\u201csafeguard\u201d) investigation brought at the\nbehest of the U.S. steel industry, President Bush in March 2002 imposed tariffs\non imports of certain steel products for three years and one day. The tariffs,\ncombined with other challenges present in the marketplace at the time and in the\nmonths that followed, boosted steel costs to the detriment of American\ncompanies that use steel to produce goods in the United States. The resulting\nnegative impact included job losses for thousands of American workers.\nThe Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition (CITAC) Foundation\nrequested a formal examination of the impact of higher steel costs on American\nsteel-consuming industries,1 and in particular, a quantification of employment\nlosses at those companies. This study employed straight-forward and widelyaccepted\nregression analysis using a variety of price and employment data to\nmaximize the reliability of the results.2 We found that:\n\u2022 200,000 Americans lost their jobs to higher steel prices during 2002.\nThese lost jobs represent approximately $4 billion in lost wages from\nFebruary to November 2002.3\n\u2022 One out of four (50,000) of these job losses occurred in the metal\nmanufacturing, machinery and equipment and transportation equipment and\nparts sectors.\n\u2022 Job losses escalated steadily over 2002, peaking in November (at 202,000\njobs), and slightly declining to 197,000 jobs in December.4\n\u2022 More American workers lost their jobs in 2002 to higher steel prices than\nthe total number employed by the U.S. steel industry itself (187,500\nAmericans were employed by U.S. steel producers in December 2002).\n\nSo yeah.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt; Trump has a point with this. Our trade deals do need to be changed to incentivize US production.\n\nNo he doesn't, and no we don't. Manufacturing has increased here, it hasn't gone down, the jobs just don't exist anymore.\n\nhttps://www.audiotech.com/trends-magazine/images/articles/2015/12/p36-1.png\n\nhttps://plot.ly/~victortchen/417/manufacturing-employment-as-a-percentage-of-nonfarm-employment.png\n\nHere are 2 graphs showing this.\n\nAnd even more:\n\nhttps://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.15.1.125\n\n&gt;&gt; **We describe the main economic arguments posed for and against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during the U.S. policy debate. To evaluate these arguments, we analyze recent trade data and survey post-NAFTA studies. We find that both the U.S. and Mexico benefit from NAFTA, with much larger relative benefits for Mexico. NAFTA also has had little effect on the U.S. labor market. These results confirm the consensus opinion of economists at the time of the debate. Finally, studies find that trade creation greatly exceeds trade diversion in the region under NAFTA, especially in intermediate goods.**\n\n\nAnd even more:\n\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/265cd8fb02fb44a69cf0eaa2063e11d9/mexico-taking-us-factory-jobs-blame-robots-instead\n\n&gt;&gt; But research shows that the automation of U.S. factories is a much bigger factor than foreign trade in the loss of factory jobs. A study at Ball State University's Center for Business and Economic Research last year found that trade accounted for just 13 percent of America's lost factory jobs. The vast majority of the lost jobs \u2014 88 percent \u2014 were taken by robots and other homegrown factors that reduce factories' need for human labor.\n\n&gt;&gt; \"We're making more with fewer people,\" says Howard Shatz, a senior economist at the Rand Corp. think tank.\nGeneral Motors, for instance, now employs barely a third of the 600,000 workers it had in the 1970s. Yet it churns out more cars and trucks than ever.\n\n&gt;&gt; In a survey by the consulting firm Deloitte, global manufacturing executives predicted that that the United States \u2014 now No. 2 \u2014 will overtake China as the most competitive country in manufacturing by 2020. (Competitiveness is measured by such factors as costs, productivity and the protection of intellectual property.)\n\n&gt;&gt; The Reshoring Initiative, a nonprofit that lobbies manufacturers to return jobs to the United States, says America was losing an average of 220,000 net jobs a year to other countries a decade ago. Now, the number being moved abroad is roughly offset by the number that are coming back or being created by foreign investment.","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh0u","retrieved_on":1486229417,"author_flair_css_class":null,"controversiality":0,"author_flair_text":null,"link_id":"t3_5p7uq9","distinguished":null,"created_utc":1484975945,"edited":1485071505,"id":"dcpd1st","parent_id":"t1_dcpbebf"}{"controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh0u","retrieved_on":1486230041,"link_id":"t3_5p7uq9","author":"pizzashill","score":13,"body":"The OP might have been about this, but that person's comment was not about this.\n\n\nOn top of that, you should have read my links.\n\nhttp://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-flips-the-script-on-jobs-reshoring-finally-outpaced-offshoring-in-2014-2015-05-01\n\n&gt;&gt; **And it\u2019s not just hard goods.

We also propose a new method to estimate sectoral trade elasticities consistent with any trade model that delivers a multiplicative gravity equation. We apply our model and use our estimated elasticities to identify the impact of NAFTA's tariff reductions. We find that Mexico's welfare increases by 1.31%, U.S.'s welfare increases by 0.08%, and Canada's welfare declines by 0.06%. We find that intra-bloc trade increases by 118% for Mexico, 11% for Canada and 41% for the U.S. We show that welfare effects from tariff reductions are reduced when the structure of production does not take into account intermediate goods or input-output linkages. Our results highlight the importance of sectoral heterogeneity, intermediate goods and sectoral linkages for the quantification of the welfare gains from tariffs reductions.\n\nOk.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt; You can spit on people and tell them it's raining all you want - just don't be surprised when a significant number of them call you on your bullshit.\n\nI mean, you just displayed you have no clue what you're talking about on even a basic level.\n\nLet me copy paste this one more time:\n\n\n&gt;&gt; **\"Competing in the world marketplace\": One of the most popular, enduring misconceptions of practical men is that countries are in competition with each other in the same way that companies in the same business are in competition.

Show me where I claimed that.\n\nYou replied to me and tried to claim US manufacturing output wasn't actually up, we're just building more expensive things.\n\nThat is a god awful argument.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; Your links are ALL related to output. How they derive their numbers is is derived from \"real manufacturing outpout\". Which is derived in dollars of product produced. But this has fundamental difficulties in tracking inflation vs quality of product. Which is why things get difficult when tracking electronics. Electronics track with inflation differently because the growth in chips and circuitry is often exponential thanks to Moore's law--this means the actual dollars economists estimate is produced is greatly inflated, even though sales of real product when tracked to general inflation is not. This is how it APPEARS that manufacturing jobs are lost to a greater degree than they are through increased production (IE automation) because productivity is skyrocketing but no new jobs are being created to account for that increase (But as I showed you in the linked paper which your quotes are based off of? The formula used doesn't account for the quirk in the electronics field and why electronics grows more rapidly based on outpout than it actually, physically does. Listen, I can't give you a semester of economics in a post--but read over the paper linked.)\n\n\nListen, the objective fact is the US manufacturing output has done nothing but increase in terms of value, you can sit here and try to mental gymnastics this all day long, you're wrong.\n\nYour argument makes no logical sense.\n\n&gt;&gt; I said it doesn't cause more jobs, because when they do the 'jobs lost' numbers, what they do is compare productivity (IE increased real dollars produced) vs many other metrics, like trade (The formulas are in the paper) and total jobs in field. That's how they figure out which % of jobs is lost where. This number is skewed though because the inflation value of electronics is grossly misinterpreted due to the nature of electronics.\n\n\nYou seem to have some weird obsession with \"electronics.\" \n\nLook, you're entitled to your opinion, I'll stick with the economic consensus that automation killed the vast majority of low end manufacturing jobs.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; My argument is that economics is relative. Obtusely linking manufacturing dollars with no context how they are derived or the total GDP they exist relative too? Is silly. As is linking exports without accounting for imports or total GDP ect. Yes, we export a lot. We still have a deficit of 40 billion PER MONTH, relative to our Economy we do not make a lot, but relative to OTHER economies, because of our size, we do. The issue is, if we had better trade deals, we could actually make A LOT MORE.\n\nLiterally delusional.

Brower of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal and Sadie Blanchard of Yale Law School published an article in the Columbia Journal of Transnational law outlining various common myths regarding ISDS. They assert that the balance of power created by international arbitration mechanisms is not nearly as asymmetric as its opponents would allege. They found that tribunals under the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) have ruled in favour of investors in 46% of cases and have typically granted less than 40% of the damages initially sought. This does not indicate any form of systemic bias in favour of investors in international arbitration courts.\n\n&gt;&gt; Additionally, governments possess a wide variety of tools to sanction breaches by investors. Aside from civil damages, governments may also seek criminal sanctions in their own courts. Expropriation of assets may also serve as an enforcement tool for wronged governments. Conversely, in developing countries with politicized judicial systems, arbitration tribunals established by trade agreements often serve as investors\u2019 only recourse in recovering damages from governments.\n\n&gt;&gt; Brower and Blanchard deconstruct allegations of ISDS eroding national sovereignty by pointing out that limiting the scope of legitimate state action is precisely the purpose of international treaties. Criticisms of this type made with respect to ISDS may be equally applied to all international conventions that include enforcement mechanisms, without which they are effectively toothless. Concerns regarding the content that is being enforced may be entirely valid. However, the mere presence of an enforcement mechanism should not be viewed as a point against the TPP.\n\n&gt;&gt; The authors of the article also state that ISDS is highly unlikely to interfere with the imposition of environmental regulations that reduce the return on certain investments. Not a single environmental regulation has been struck down via ISDS as of the time of writing, and no damages have been awarded to investors pursuant to a claim regarding the enforcement of an environmental law.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","retrieved_on":1486232602,"author_flair_css_class":null,"controversiality":1,"author_flair_text":null,"link_id":"t3_5p9fwi","created_utc":1484990748,"distinguished":null,"parent_id":"t1_dcpizey","id":"dcpjafv","edited":false}{"author_flair_css_class":null,"controversiality":0,"author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh0u","retrieved_on":1486232689,"link_id":"t3_5p7uq9","author":"pizzashill","score":3,"stickied":false,"gilded":0,"body":"&gt;&gt; I never said U.S. manufacturing wasn't up.

The vast majority of the lost jobs \u2014 88 percent \u2014 were taken by robots and other homegrown factors that reduce factories' need for human labor.\n\"We're making more with fewer people,\" says Howard Shatz, a senior economist at the Rand Corp. think tank.

The Antarctic is not warming as fast as the Arctic is, said Zwally, who led the NASA study. \"It's more like the global change [rates],\" Zwally said. In other words, the Antarctic region is seeing a regional temperature rise that matches the temperature rise seen on average around the world, instead of the much higher temperature rise in the Arctic regions noted by NOAA. Scientists think the Antarctic region is experiencing a slower temperature rise than the Arctic, because the ozone hole over Antarctic has created weather trends, specifically in East Antarctica, that has slowed it down.\n\n&gt;&gt; East Antarctica is not warming as fast as West Antarctica \u2014 that's the part of Antarctica that is the most susceptible to ice loss,\" Mann said. In 2007, researchers reported in the journal Geophysical Research Letters that they had found a link between this phenomenon and the ozone hole over Antarctica. Depleting ozone in the upper atmosphere changes wind dynamics there, Mann said. That change causes a strengthening of the jet stream and the polar winds, but it also traps the cold air in the regions around East Antarctica, creating a cooling effect.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.livescience.com/52831-antarctica-gains-ice-but-still-warming.html","parent_id":"t1_dcxodrk","id":"dcxoks0","edited":false,"created_utc":1485445075,"distinguished":null}{"created_utc":1485453235,"distinguished":null,"parent_id":"t1_dcxvvdv","id":"dcxvzbe","edited":false,"author":"pizzashill","score":2,"gilded":0,"stickied":false,"body":"Not really sure how this is a \"crisis.\"\n\nThe goal of science is to interrogate the world and understand how it works.\n\nSomething being proven wrong in science is a good thing.

I didn't say I wanted it to happen, just that I'd vote yes, and it was more of a joke than anything else. \n\n\n&gt;&gt; You don't get to just say \"nuh uh\" without proving it. Prove that hating race is worse than hating demographics. Prove it.\n\nUh, you're the one making the claim it is, the burden is on you.

I'm too ignorant to understand that many others have different views and that many of them did not want Clinton in office.\"\n\n\nYou seem to be confused here.

That's what this entire argument is about. Also, taking away rights from people you hate is not at all justified.\n\n**Was clearly a joke.**\n\nThis sub is like the right wing SRS.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; That isn't a strawman.

It is no one's responsibility but the student to pay for their loans. I don't believe in state-sponsored charity.

Education improves society, access to education improves society.\n\nPS: You have no right to your pretax income, so your argument makes no sense. \n\n\n&gt;&gt; There is zero logical or scientific differentiation between a fetus and a person with rights.\n\nOne is a lump of cells, one is a person. By your logic, there's nothing different between a tumor and a person with rights. \n\n\n&gt;&gt; An organism is declared dead when they have no cellular processes and they have no internal homeostasis. This is when rights are revoked. The logical contrapositive states that all beings with cellular reproduction and homeostasis are given rights. This means fetsus's as well. What scientifically separates a fetus from a human person that makes the fetus's rights null and void?\n\nThe fact a fetus is not a person, it is a lump of cells, a parasite.
