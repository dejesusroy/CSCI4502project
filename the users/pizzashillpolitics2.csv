So during the first quarter of the year steel producers began to push for higher prices and they had the market power of steel shortages to force through some price increases.6 In addition, a host of antidumping and countervailing duties went into effect at the end of 2001, raising steel costs. Antidumping and countervailing duties were imposed on imports of hot-rolled carbon steel flat products imported from 11 countries between September and December 2001, boosting costs – or eliminating foreign supply -- of this important product. Antidumping or countervailing duties were imposed on imports of stainless steel bar from five countries in March 2002 with the same consequences. These duties were imposed in addition to the steel tariffs. Ultimately unsuccessful investigations were launched against imports of oil country tubular goods and cold rolled carbon sheet, disrupting supplies and prices of these products during the course of the investigations.  >> **The steel supply shortage problem deepened because of uncertainty associated with the tariffs.** **Importers stopped ordering steel in January waiting to see what the President would decide.**  **Thus, product that would have been entering the market in March, April and May was absent. Import supply did not recover to the benefit of steel-consumers until September (and it has since fallen off again). Steel consumers scrambled to order steel from U.S. producers, many of whom would not or could not supply them with needed product, and spot prices for steel soared.7**  >> Domestic steel supplies were so tight that in May 2002 U.S. producers supplied over 90 percent of the market, when 80-85 percent is more typical.8  >> The results: shortages and very high prices, particularly last Summer and Fall. Steel transaction (spot) prices – more than half of major carbon and stainless steel producers purchase steel on the spot market9  -- began to accelerate in March, reaching a peak in July and August. According to price tracking data from Purchasing Magazine, hot-rolled sheet transaction prices were 81.8 percent higher in July 2002 than in January 2002; cold-rolled sheet prices were 69.4 percent higher, and hot-dipped galvanized prices 62.1 percent higher. These are key products, used to make products ranging from cars to lawn-mower blades. Increases in the prices of steel sold directly by steel manufacturers (the so-called “producer price index”) to their customers also showed strong increases over the period. In December 2002, the producer price index for hotrolled steel was 27 percent above the index recorded in December 2001, and the index for cold-rolled steel was 19 percent higher over the same period. 10 ","False","0","politics","pizzashill","1","t3_5pfr08","0","null","null","1486258153","t5_2cneq"

Second, you aren't telling me what it is you think your link says, you're trying to cite the number that isn't accounting for any factors.  http://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-true-story-of-the-gender-pay-gap-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/  >> **GOLDIN: Well, it is true that if you took individuals in the labor force and took those who were working full-time, full-year, and took all women, took the median annual earnings of those women and took the same thing for men, and divided the two, it would be .77 or around that, OK?  And that’s a number that has increased. In early 1970’s it was .59 and there was a mantra, “59 cents on a dollar, that’s not enough, OK?  We are equal to men, we deserve more.”  So, is this for equal work?  Is it equal individuals?  What economists do is they use data to figure out whether the individuals are the same; they try to make them comparable as possible; they squeeze out these differences and productive attributes; they look for individuals who have the same education, the same labor-force participation rates over their life cycle, etc.  And they squeeze those out and we still get a number that’s less than one. **So, does that mean that women are receiving lower pay for equal work?  That is possibly the case in certain places, but by and large, it’s not that. It’s something else.**  >> GOLDIN: It’s hard to find the smoking guns, OK?  The smoking guns existed in the past. I have found many a smoking gun where you find actual evidence of firms saying, for example, “I do not hire Nroes.” Or, “I do not hire women.” I mean, you actually find these in 1939.  We don’t find those smoking guns now, but what we do try to do is hold everything constant that we can hold, get the best data that we can get. And what remains we don’t call discrimination, we call wage discrimination. Discrimination is such a loaded word that we don’t want to use that, so we use quotes around “wage discrimination.” And so the first thing is, what type of data do you need to do that? It would be incredibly rich data. And a couple of people have put together data using administrative records that are phenomenally good data that can hold lots of things constant, that can track individuals over their lifetimes and get to the answer. **And the answer is that it’s a pretty small number, this number for wage discrimination once you hold lots of things constant.  It’s probably there, but we’re not quite certain whether these differences are due to the fact that women, even those without kids, have more responsibilities or take more responsibilities in their own families — taking care of their parents, for example.  So the answer is that we don’t have tons of evidence that it’s true discrimination.**  >> **GOLDIN: I like to think about an individual who gets a degree — let’s say a law degree — and it’s a woman, and now I have an individual a man who gets a law degree. And they graduate from law school and they’re both equally brilliant, and they both get jobs in approximately the same type of firm. By and large they’re going to earn approximately the same amount when they start. Things will continue in their lives — they’ll both perhaps find partners, get married, have kids. It’s often the case that women will leave the very large law firms that put a lot of time demands on them and go to smaller firms or become corporate counsel, become part-time corporate counsel, perhaps, for a while. They will go to small firms where the workload is somewhat different. They may work in fact the same number of hours, but they may work hours that are their hours rather than the hours imposed on them by the firm. The woman will then begin to make — if she’s the one who did this — she will make considerably less than the man.  And a lot of what we see — not all of it — but a lot of what we see is this choice to go into occupations that have less expensive temporal flexibility, that allow individuals to do their work on their own time.**  >> GOLDIN: By and large, it appears that there’s just a very high cost of temporal flexibility in certain occupations. And part of this is that people don’t have good substitutes for themselves in certain cases.  So, you are doing a merger in an acquisition, you’re a lawyer, you are a consultant — whatever it is — the client might say, “I want you there. I want you there all the time.  I want to call you at 2 in the morning. I want you to be there on Sunday, on holidays. I want you to go to Japan whenever I say that you should.”  Well, that’s a tremendous demand. So an individual who values their family time would say, “I’m not doing that.” So therefore if a woman wants to — law, for example, is a good example — if a woman wants to practice law, she has a law degree, she enjoys practicing law, being a corporate counsel would give her more flexibility. That doesn’t mean that she’s working fewer hours than she would’ve worked otherwise, but she can work her hours, and she gets paid somewhat less.

And there won’t be any executive orders to address the significant under-representation of men in graduate schools by creating a White House Council on Boys and Men like the executive order issued by President Obama in 2009 to create the “White House Council on Women and Girls.” Finally, despite their stated commitment to “gender equity,” the hundreds of university women’s centers around the country are unlikely to show any concern about the significant gender inequities in graduate school enrollment and degrees, and universities will not be allocating funding to set up men’s centers on college campuses or providing funding for graduate scholarships for men.  >> Bottom Line: If there is any attention about gender differences in the CGS annual report, it will likely be about the fact that women are a minority in 4 of the 11 fields of graduate study including engineering and computer science (a gender gap which some consider to be a “national crisis”), with calls for greater awareness of female under-representation in STEM graduate fields of study and careers (except for the STEM field of biology, where women are over-represented).

In the main experiment, 363 faculty members evaluated narrative summaries describing hypothetical female and male applicants for tenure-track assistant professorships who shared the same lifestyle (e.g., single without children, married with children). Applicants' profiles were systematically varied to disguise identically rated scholarship; profiles were counterbalanced by gender across faculty to enable between-faculty comparisons of hiring preferences for identically qualified women versus men. Results revealed a 2:1 preference for women by faculty of both genders across both math-intensive and non–math-intensive fields, with the single exception of male economists, who showed no gender preference. Results were replicated using weighted analyses to control for national sample characteristics. In follow-up experiments, 144 faculty evaluated competing applicants with differing lifestyles (e.g., divorced mother vs. married father), and 204 faculty compared same-gender candidates with children, but differing in whether they took 1-y-parental leaves in graduate school. Women preferred divorced mothers to married fathers; men preferred mothers who took leaves to mothers who did not. In two validation studies, 35 engineering faculty provided rankings using full curricula vitae instead of narratives, and 127 faculty rated one applicant rather than choosing from a mixed-gender group; the same preference for women was shown by faculty of both genders. These results suggest it is a propitious time for women launching careers in academic science. Messages to the contrary may discourage women from applying for STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) tenure-track assistant professorships.

Brower of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal and Sadie Blanchard of Yale Law School published an article in the Columbia Journal of Transnational law outlining various common myths regarding ISDS. They assert that the balance of power created by international arbitration mechanisms is not nearly as asymmetric as its opponents would allege. They found that tribunals under the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) have ruled in favour of investors in 46% of cases and have typically granted less than 40% of the damages initially sought. This does not indicate any form of systemic bias in favour of investors in international arbitration courts.  >> Additionally, governments possess a wide variety of tools to sanction breaches by investors. Aside from civil damages, governments may also seek criminal sanctions in their own courts. Expropriation of assets may also serve as an enforcement tool for wronged governments. Conversely, in developing countries with politicized judicial systems, arbitration tribunals established by trade agreements often serve as investors’ only recourse in recovering damages from governments.  >> Brower and Blanchard deconstruct allegations of ISDS eroding national sovereignty by pointing out that limiting the scope of legitimate state action is precisely the purpose of international treaties. Criticisms of this type made with respect to ISDS may be equally applied to all international conventions that include enforcement mechanisms, without which they are effectively toothless. Concerns regarding the content that is being enforced may be entirely valid. However, the mere presence of an enforcement mechanism should not be viewed as a point against the TPP.  >> The authors of the article also state that ISDS is highly unlikely to interfere with the imposition of environmental regulations that reduce the return on certain investments. Not a single environmental regulation has been struck down via ISDS as of the time of writing, and no damages have been awarded to investors pursuant to a claim regarding the enforcement of an environmental law.  >> Claims that ISDS leads to “regulatory chill,” where governments are dissuaded from enacting environmental legislation out of concern for litigation in ISDS tribunals, are equally unfounded. To successfully claim damages from a state party, plaintiffs must show that the measure was “pretextual, discriminatory, or lacking in due process.” They must demonstrate that the supposed environmental law in fact targeted them unfairly, either by not similarly binding domestic investors or by blatantly serving as a pretext for favouring domestic industry. Given that no ISDS claim concerning environmental regulation has succeeded to date, it is exceedingly unlikely that investors will be willing to face the steep costs of arbitration in hopes of an improbable victory.  >> Investor-state dispute resolution has become a standard feature of international trade, benefitting both investors, who are assured of fair treatment in arbitration courts, and developing countries, which benefit from increased levels of foreign investment and an effective subsidy for their judicial systems. Provisions in the TPP establishing such a framework are not unusual in the extent to which they bind governments. Rather, they provide the possibility of enforcement of the landmark trade agreement. While certain groups may have other legitimate grievances regarding the TPP, the inclusion of an ISDS mechanism is in the interest of all parties involved.

LOL.  https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/upshot/the-problem-with-gop-plans-to-sell-health-insurance-across-state-lines.html  >> In 2012, Ms. Corlette and co-authors completed a study of a number of states that passed laws to allow out-of-state insurance sales. Not a single out-of-state insurer had taken them up on the offer. As Ms. Corlette’s paper highlighted, there is no federal impediment to across-state-lines arrangements. The main difficulty is that most states want to regulate local products themselves. The Affordable Care Act actually has a few provisions to encourage more regional and national sales of insurance, but they have not proved popular.  >> Insurers have been muted in their enthusiasm for G.O.P. across-state-lines plans. Neither America’s Health Insurance Plans, the lobbying group for most private insurers, nor the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association have endorsed such a plan when it has come before Congress.  >> There’s a part of the health insurance market where regulations are largely identical around the country: the one for private Medicare Advantage plans. If uniform rules alone could ensure a broad array of competitors, you might expect to see many insurers participating. But that does not seem to be the case.  >> A recent report found that, in 97 percent of counties, the market for Medicare Advantage plans was “highly concentrated,” meaning very limited choices.  >> Beyond regulations and doctors, demographics help explain why insurance is cheaper in some places than others. Insurance tends to be less expensive in states like Utah and Colorado, where more people are young and healthy. If customers in New York wanted to start buying Utah plans, they might face two surprises: fewer local doctors and higher costs related to the health of the local population.  >> “I’ve tried for 10 years to explain this to Republicans; it is a big problem,” said Merrill Matthews, a resident scholar at the Institute for Policy Innovation, which focuses on free-market solutions to policy problems. “Just because a good affordable policy is available in another state doesn’t mean that I would be able to get the network of physicians and the good prices that are available in that other state.”  >> Critics of the across-state-lines plan worry about negative consequences of letting insurers shop for the state regulator of their choice. Just as many businesses tend to incorporate in Delaware, or credit card companies have headquarters in South Dakota, insurers may end up congregating in whatever state offers the most lenient regulations. That could mean that customers who get sick could be harmed because there are few comprehensive policies available, or because consumer protections are weak when things go wrong.  >> Right now, the Affordable Care Act sets up some minimum standards for insurance plans sold everywhere, but since the Republican proposals include repealing the law, those limitations would presumably disappear.  >> There’s one other problem with Mr. Trump’s statement: The across-state-lines issue affects only individuals and small businesses, and rarely matters for large companies like his Trump Organization. His campaign wouldn’t confirm the company’s insurance arrangement, but nearly every large American company is what’s called self-insured. That means it is not subject to state insurance regulation.  >> Truly national health insurance companies are still rare, in part because building a national provider network is so difficult. The limited choices Mr. Trump faced were most likely those of the national market and not the result of varying state regulation.

In a survey by the consulting firm Deloitte, global manufacturing executives predicted that that the United States — now No. 2 — will overtake China as the most competitive country in manufacturing by 2020. (Competitiveness is measured by such factors as costs, productivity and the protection of intellectual property.)  >> The Reshoring Initiative, a nonprofit that lobbies manufacturers to return jobs to the United States, says America was losing an average of 220,000 net jobs a year to other countries a decade ago.

In general and primary elections alone, more than 1 billion ballots were cast in that period.”  1  >> In 2012, a team of students led by the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University analyzed 2,068 alleged election-fraud cases since 2000 and concluded that “while fraud has occurred, the rate is infinitesimal, and in-person voter impersonation on Election Day, which prompted 37 state legislatures to enact or consider tough voter ID laws, is virtually non-existent.”  2  >> In October 2002, the Justice Department in the George W. Bush administration introduced the Ballot Access and Voting Integrity Initiative, which was charged, in part, with targeting voter fraud. But as Washington Post columnist Harold Meyerson pointed out in 2007, the efforts between October 2002 and September 2005 resulted in “just 38 cases [being] brought nationally, and of those, 14 ended in dismissals or acquittals, 11 in guilty pleas, and 13 in convictions.”  Stop trying to lie about voter fraud, it's getting embarrassing.  >> “These allegations are false. Fraud almost never takes place through in-person voting (and certainly not enough to swing an election),” Heather Gerken, a professor of law at Yale Law School and an election law expert, told us via email.  >> Gerken, who was a senior legal adviser to the Obama campaigns in 2008 and 2012, added, “There have been astonishingly few examples, and with good reason. It is far, far, far easier to steal an election by bribing an election official or mail-in/absentee voting. Unsurprisingly, all the evidence of serious fraud concerns the latter sort.”  >> And Nathaniel Persily, a professor of law at Stanford University who worked on a bipartisan presidential commission formed after the 2012 election to address the issue of long lines at polling places, told us, “There is very little voter fraud. There is virtually no voter impersonation fraud. Where there is fraud it is usually done at the wholesale rather than retail level — usually with absentee or mail ballots.”   The idea that there's some epidemic of illegals voting, or some voter fraud problem here is literally insane.","False","0","politics","pizzashill","11","t3_5q29cq","0","null","null","1486421988","t5_2cneq"

To evaluate these arguments, we analyze recent trade data and survey post-NAFTA studies. We find that both the U.S. and Mexico benefit from NAFTA, with much larger relative benefits for Mexico. NAFTA also has had little effect on the U.S. labor market. These results confirm the consensus opinion of economists at the time of the debate. Finally, studies find that trade creation greatly exceeds trade diversion in the region under NAFTA, especially in intermediate goods.

We also propose a new method to estimate sectoral trade elasticities consistent with any trade model that delivers a multiplicative gravity equation. We apply our model and use our estimated elasticities to identify the impact of NAFTA's tariff reductions. We find that Mexico's welfare increases by 1.31%, U.S.'s welfare increases by 0.08%, and Canada's welfare declines by 0.06%.

The estimated cost to Mexican producers of dumping-level corn prices was $6.6 billion over the nine-year period, an average of $99 per hectare per year, or $38 per ton.  >> Meats were exported at below-cost prices because U.S. producers benefited from below-cost soybeans and corn, key components in feed.  This so-called implicit subsidy to meat producers resulted in dumping margins of 5-10% on exported meat.  This cost Mexican livestock producers who did not use imported feed an estimated $3.2 billion between 1997 and 2005.  The largest losses were in beef, at $1.6 billion, or $175 million per year.  >> We estimate total losses to Mexican producers from dumping-level U.S. export prices at $12.8 billion from 1997-2005 for the eight products (in constant 2000 US dollars).  To put these losses in context, the average annual loss of $1.4 billion is equivalent to 10% of the value of all Mexican agricultural exports to the United States and greater than the current value of Mexican tomato exports to the United States.","False","0","politics","pizzashill","5","t3_5qbng4","0","null","null","1486459716","t5_2cneq"

This post is not intended to make a specific claim on my part concerning how many non-citizens voted in 2016. It has a much narrower aim. My goal was to show that an extrapolation from my coauthored work on the 2008 election to the 2016 election did not support the arguments some seemed to be making that the entire popular vote margin for Clinton was due to illegal votes by non-citizens. In this post I do my own calculation of that extrapolation for the purpose of demonstrating that this extrapolation would not support that claim. There are a number of reasons why one should be cautious about extrapolating from the 2008 CCES data to 2016. Many things can and have changed over the course of eight years. For example, a number of states have made efforts to use matching of records to remove non-citizen registrants from voter rolls. For example, on this blog I have recently highlighted data from Virginia and North Carolina concerning such matching efforts. These non-citizens are no longer on voter rolls. There are other states that have been even more aggressive about the issue of attempting to verify that registered voters are citizens. Furthermore, although the evidence from our 2014 paper suggests that it is only partially effective, many states have moved to adopt tighter identification requirements. The 2008 estimate is inherently uncertain. It depends upon a number of assumptions including assumptions about the validity of the survey data. Our critics have made a variety of arguments and I encourage readers to evaluate those arguments along with our responses to them. In the absence of other data, arguably an extrapolation from the earlier (2008) numbers is the best one can do.

Like I said, women are more likely to abuse children than men are.   >> Also note that there are also other reasons for opposing the bill. It also provides stringent conditions for maintaining alimony that could make it far more difficult for one party to provide for the child.

Alimony reform needs to happen, men should not be made to pay for women just because they were married.  The bill even grandfathered older women in and was aimed at younger women.   I don't care about the florida bar, they're indoctrinated in feminist trash. This bill was fixing a biased system, the feminists couldn't have that.   >> What gave you the idea that I am sexist?  The mental gymnastics you go through to defend a cult that is provably sexist.   >> This is generally what you do when you lose an argument.

The recovery of Aristotle's texts is considered a major period in mediaeval philosophy, leading to Aristotelianism.[1][2][3] Because some of Aristotle's newly translated views discounted the notions of a personal God, immortal soul, or creation, various leaders of the Catholic Church were inclined to censor those views for decades,[1] such as lists of forbidden books in the Condemnations of 1210–1277 at the University of Paris. Meanwhile, Thomas Aquinas (c.1225–1274), at the end of that time period, was able to reconcile the viewpoints of Aristotelianism and Christianity, primarily in his work, Summa Theologica (1265–1274).[1]  >> The rejection, by powerful religious leaders, to censor some recovered books of Aristotle, opened a new path to allow other ideas to be considered, or taught, regarding subjects in the banned books. Eventually, new ideas became more widespread, such as the heliocentric (sun-centered) system noted by Galileo Galilei (1564–1642), which rejected Aristotle's Earth-centered system, even though Galileo's ideas were later censored by Church officials during his lifetime, as well.

[54] There is no legal basis a state can point to for unilaterally seceding.[56] Many scholars hold that the Confederate secession was blatantly illegal. The Articles of Confederation explicitly state the Union is ""perpetual""; the U.S. Constitution declares itself an even ""more perfect union"" than the Articles of Confederation.[57] Other scholars, while not necessarily disagreeing that the secession was illegal, point out that sovereignty is often de facto an ""extralegal"" question. Had the Confederacy won, any illegality of its actions under U.S. law would have been rendered irrelevant, just as the undisputed illegality of American rebellion under the British law of 1775 was rendered irrelevant.

It's operating on a lot of flawed assumptions with conflicting evidence.  >> Formal equality is about equal opportunities to participate, and to make the choices that affect your life. Real equality is about equal distribution of participation, resources, power and responsibilities.  Right here? This is absurd, it seems to think that men and women are exactly the same in every way and if something isn't 50-50 it's because of sexism.  We know for a fact there are biological differences between men and women that aren't simply the result of how we socialize boys and girls.  For example, we know baby boys are more interested in mechanical objects than baby girls are.   http://www.math.kth.se/matstat/gru/godis/sex.pdf  Here's a study on that. Equality of opportunity is what we need to aim for, and we absolutely have equality of opportunity. This is one of the major beefs I have with modern 3rd wave feminism, they seem to think they can just throw out biology and assume there are no differences between males and females, that's just.. absurd.  >> Culture and tradition are important to Norwegian women. Traditional activities such as knitting, sewing, crocheting, cooking, are building blocks of our identity. We pride ourselves in practicing and perpetuating the traditions that belong to the homemaker. ""Rose"" blogs have thousands of followers in Norway, mainly among the younger generation. Most Norwegian women value these aspects of life in line with our professional life.  Oh no, we can't have people doing what they enjoy, we can't have that at all! Seriously, does this person think women are oppressed in Norway or something? The author is literally angry because people are doing things they value, because those things don't fall in line with his/her worldview.  >> Fathers are allotted 10 weeks of parental leave. This is to strengthen the fathers' relationships with their children and to signal the need for fathers to participate in childcare -- 68 per cent of fathers take their full quota or more. Women take the most the parental leave; the full period is 49 weeks with full pay. For many women, the stay at home is longer. The government offers a cash-for-care benefit to parents who decline public day care facilities until the child is two years old. More women choose this route. In 2011, 84 per cent of those receiving the benefit were women (Ellingsæter 2012). This means that some women have been out of the workforce for 2 years, while men have only been out for 10 weeks.   Holy shit, again, what is wrong with this person? The country gives them an absurd amount of leave, while they're being paid, and offers free child care to them. **Women are making the choice to stay at home longer, this system is beyond generous.**  So we see the author again, complaining that women are making choices he/she doesn't like. Even when women are offered free child care, 49 weeks of leave with pay, they still find a way to complain.  >> The entry of women into positions of power and decision-making in society is important for the development of a democratic and egalitarian society. Most political parties have introduced gender quotas. In the 2013 national election, women gained 39.6 per cent of the seats in the parliament. In local government, women occupy about one third of the seats. Women's labour market participation in Norway is among the highest in Europe. However, women still earn 86 per cent of a man's wage. Women make up 71 percent of the public sector and 34 per cent of women work part-time, compared to 14 percent men. Despite working part-time, the share of women working outside regular hours has gradually decreased in the last seven years. Work hours are upheld and respected; most employees can, if they choose to, leave their work place at 4 o'clock sharp. This makes it possible for mothers and fathers to pick up children in kindergartens and attend their needs for activities and other support in the afternoon.   And yet again, we see this person trying to paint something good as a negative. Complaining because women aren't making the choices he/she likes. A bonus wage gap myth being thrown in there too.  Women make less because they overwhelmingly go into lower paying fields and work less hours, they aren't literally being paid less for the same work. And again, as seen above, Norway offers them free child care and leave with pay, they have no excuse here, they could easily go back to work if they wanted. Does it not occur to this person that maybe men and women are just different?   >> Gender equality and the welfare state are mutually inclusive -- the welfare state is a precondition for gender equality and gender equality is necessary to develop and maintain the welfare state. Yet, Norway continues to face challenges to achieve ""real"" gender equality.   No, they've achieved equality, that equality just doesn't line up with your trash view that everything has to be 50-50 and men are women are the exact same.  I had to stop reading here, this person is delusional.

Academic research does not provide much support for this claim. The evidence suggests that when immigration increases the supply of labor, firms increase investment to offset any reduction in capital per worker, thereby keeping average wages from falling over the long term. Moreover, immigrants are often imperfect substitutes for native-born workers in U.S. labor markets. That means they do not compete for the same jobs and put minimal downward pressure on natives’ wages. This might explain why competition from new immigrants has mostly affected earlier immigrants, who experienced significant reductions in wages from the surge in immigration. In contrast, studies find that immigration has actually raised average wages of native-born workers during the last few decades.  >> Immigrants are at the forefront of innovation and ingenuity in the United States, accounting for a disproportionately high share of patent filings, science and technology graduates, and senior positions at top venture capital-funded firms. In addition, the presence of immigrants often creates opportunities for less-skilled native workers to become more specialized in their work, thereby increasing their productivity.  >> Immigration generally also improves the government’s fiscal situation, as many immigrants pay more in taxes over a lifetime than they consume in government services. However, native-born residents of states with large concentrations of less-educated immigrants may face larger tax burdens, as these immigrants pay less in taxes and are more likely to send children to public schools.  >> A popular view is that immigrants are taking jobs from American citizens. However, although immigrants increase the supply of labor, they also spend their wages on homes, food, TVs and other goods and services and expand domestic economic demand. This increased demand, in turn, generates more jobs to build those homes, make and sell food, and transport TVs.  >> Most empirical studies indicate long-term benefits for natives’ employment and wages from immigration, although some studies suggest that these gains come at the cost of short-term losses from lower wages and higher unemployment. Standard economic theory implies that while higher labor supply from immigration may initially depress wages, over time firms increase investment to restore the amount of capital per worker, which then restores wages. Steady growth in the capital-labor ratio prevents workers’ average productivity, and therefore their average wages from declining over the long run. Figure 2 shows the pre-1980 trend in the capital-labor ratio extrapolated over the next few decades – the period when U.S. immigration accelerated. Consistent with the theory, the actual capital-labor ratio did not significantly or permanently deviate from that trend after 1980.","False","0","politics","pizzashill","6","t3_5r0y4y","0","null","null","1486557844","t5_2cneq"

I'll copy paste the relevant part.  >> Spending your entire life insulting the other tribe and talking about how terrible they are makes you look, well, tribalistic. It is definitely not high class. So when members of the Blue Tribe decide to dedicate their entire life to yelling about how terrible the Red Tribe is, they make sure that instead of saying “the Red Tribe”, they say “America”, or “white people”, or “straight white men”. That way it’s humble self-criticism. They are so interested in justice that they are willing to critique their own beloved side, much as it pains them to do so. We know they are not exaggerating, because one might exaggerate the flaws of an enemy, but that anyone would exaggerate their own flaws fails the criterion of embarrassment.  >> The Blue Tribe always has an excuse at hand to persecute and crush any Red Tribers unfortunate enough to fall into its light-matter-universe by defining them as all-powerful domineering oppressors. They appeal to the fact that this is definitely the way it works in the Red Tribe’s dark-matter-universe, and that’s in the same country so it has to be the same community for all intents and purposes. As a result, every Blue Tribe institution is permanently licensed to take whatever emergency measures are necessary against the Red Tribe, however disturbing they might otherwise seem.  >> And so how virtuous, how noble the Blue Tribe! Perfectly tolerant of all of the different groups that just so happen to be allied with them, never intolerant unless it happen to be against intolerance itself. Never stooping to engage in petty tribal conflict like that awful Red Tribe, but always nobly criticizing their own culture and striving to make it better!  >> Sorry. But I hope this is at least a little convincing. The weird dynamic of outgroup-philia and ingroup-phobia isn’t anything of the sort. It’s just good old-fashioned in-group-favoritism and outgroup bashing, a little more sophisticated and a little more sneaky.","False","0","politics","pizzashill","1","t3_5r0v8q","0","null","null","1486559350","t5_2cneq"

I suspect you're aware of the narrative that we have a crisis for women in education because they're a minority in 4 STEM fields, right? It's all anyone talks about, but did you know women are a majority in the other 7 doctoral fields and overall 60% of the college population?  When's the last time you heard the government bring that up?  http://www.aei.org/publication/stunning-college-degree-gap-women-have-earned-almost-10-million-more-college-degrees-than-men-since-1982/  https://www.aei.org/publication/women-earned-majority-of-doctoral-degrees-in-2014-for-6th-straight-year-and-outnumber-men-in-grad-school-136-to-100/  The second actually sums it up.  >>  Here’s my prediction – the facts that: a) men are underrepresented in graduate school enrollment overall (100 men were enrolled in 2014 for every 136.4 women), b) men received fewer master’s (41% of the total) and doctoral degrees (47.8% of the total) than women in 2014, and c) men were underrepresented in 7 out of 11 graduate fields of study at both the master’s and doctoral levels last year will get no attention at all from feminists, gender activists, women’s centers, the media, universities, and anybody in the higher education industry.  >> Additionally, there will be no calls for government studies, or increased government funding to address the significant gender disparities favoring women in graduate schools, and nobody will refer to the gender graduate school enrollment and degree gaps favoring women as a problem or a “crisis.” Further, neither President Obama nor Congress will address the gender graduate enrollment and degree gaps favoring women by invoking the Title IX gender-equity law, like they have threatened to do for the gender gap in some college math and science programs. And there won’t be any executive orders to address the significant under-representation of men in graduate schools by creating a White House Council on Boys and Men like the executive order issued by President Obama in 2009 to create the “White House Council on Women and Girls.” Finally, despite their stated commitment to “gender equity,” the hundreds of university women’s centers around the country are unlikely to show any concern about the significant gender inequities in graduate school enrollment and degrees, and universities will not be allocating funding to set up men’s centers on college campuses or providing funding for graduate scholarships for men.  >> Bottom Line: If there is any attention about gender differences in the CGS annual report, it will likely be about the fact that women are a minority in 4 of the 11 fields of graduate study including engineering and computer science (a gender gap which some consider to be a “national crisis”), with calls for greater awareness of female under-representation in STEM graduate fields of study and careers (except for the STEM field of biology, where women are over-represented). But don’t expect any concern about the fact that men have increasingly become the second sex in higher education. The concern about gender imbalances will remain extremely selective, and will only focus on cases when women, not men, are underrepresented and in the minority.

As I write, the number one video cassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. Beavis and Butthead remains popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.

We've arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements - transportation, communications, and all other indus-tries; agriculture, medicine, education, entertainment, protecting the environment; and even the key democratic institution of voting - profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.  >> Avoidable human misery is more often caused not so much by stupidity as by ignorance, particularly our ignorance about ourselves.

Speer reports that ""Hitler had been much impressed by a scrap of history he had learned from a delegation of distinguished Arabs.""[2] The delegation had speculated that the world would have become ""Mohammedan"" if the Berbers and Arabs had won the Battle of Tours in the 8th Century AD, and that the Germans would have become heirs to ""a religion that believed in spreading the faith by the sword and in subjugating all nations to that faith. Such a creed was perfectly suited to the German temperament.""[3] Speer then presents Hitler's claims on this subject:  >> Hitler said that the conquering Arabs, because of their racial inferiority, would in the long run have been unable to contend with the harsher climate of the country. They could not have kept down the more vigorous natives, so that ultimately not Arabs but Islamized Germans could have stood at the head of this Mohammedan Empire.  >> Similarly, Hitler was transcribed as saying: ""Had Charles Martel not been victorious at Poitiers [...] then we should in all probability have been converted to Mohammedanism, that cult which glorifies the heroism and which opens up the seventh Heaven to the bold warrior alone. Then the Germanic races would have conquered the world.""[5]  >> According to Speer, Hitler stated in private, ""The Mohammedan religion too would have been much more compatible to us than Christianity.
