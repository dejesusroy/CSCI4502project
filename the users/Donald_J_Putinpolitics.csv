Just downloading and reading public available material is unlikely to be viewed as a crime unless you use material to steal someone’s identity or commit a collateral crime.

"Donald_J_Putin","8","False","0","While unfortunate, its pretty much standard in ECON 101 textbooks to call the tax revenues v. tax rate graph the ""Laffer curve"" (as if it was a discovery of laffer, which is isn't).  But there is no question that a rate of zero gets zerto taxes and a rate of 100% raises zero taxes, and a maximum occurs somewhere in between the two.  But what Laffer (and the supply siders) are dishonest or ignorant on is the rate at which the curve starts bending down.  All accounts show that it is far beyond the 30-40% of most western countries.  Romer published a paper a couple years back estimating it around 84%.  So Laffer was wrong about the Reagan tax cuts (but perhaps not in regards to the Kennedy tax cuts).  Having that out of the way, what it means is that whenever GOP propose tax cuts, they can make up any revenue figures they want by using ""dynamic scoring"".  Essentially this means they are looking at the Laffer curve and can project their policy as revenue increasing, despite academic literature (and many of CBO reports) to the contrary.","politics","0","maryland-flag","Maryland","t5_2cneq","1486157981","t3_5oq0nu","null","1484767905","dclgqq0","False","t1_dclawiq"

I'm definitely left/center left type (a compromising lefty), but I like the left because we take on all the social and economic battles together.  I'm not really excited about, say, the few ""open borders"" groups, or the trade protectionist folks, but what the left is good at is being accepting of those supporting broad causes.  I wish this was improved among democratic leaning voters.  I know real change needs more than just a centrist democratic majority, and the far left people belong there to push us all to make progress.  But we also need to win more conservative areas in the midwest where the best way is through blue dog types.  Especially for POTUS - which is why I really supported Clinton.  Her loss wasn't because of policy.  It wasn't because she wasn't progressive enough.  Policy wasn't what drove those voters in the rust belt.  It was identity politics, and (even unconscious) feeling of loss of white americans being valued.    Maybe Sherrod Brown is someone who can bring solid liberalism to these working class midwestern states.  Not necessarily at the top of the ticket.  But its clear that these less informed voters are looking at how someone speaks to them, not the content of their policies.

"Donald_J_Putin","12","False","0","While I don't think impeachment will happen - not over the emoluments at least - after the president is impeached, the remainder of the term led by Pence will have virtually zero political power.  I can't imagine going through a nasty impeachment and then have Pence come in as a popular figure with political momentum to do anything.  Remember, impeachment will only happen if the GOP congress starts fearing for their re-elections.  Which means Pence, being tied to Trump, won't have much more support.  Especially if he continues with these really unpopular pushes to gut government and pass any radical legislative changes.    An impeachment also gets the attention of a lot of voters.  It's not like people will suddenly forget or not be aware of the Trump-Pence administration that resulted in impeachment.    I admit that its possible that Pence as Potus could be even more damaging - had he been at the top of the ticket at the start.  But coming in as the replacement for a disgraced loser won't give him much power to make significant legislative change.  To repeat, though, I don't think the GOP will make any move to impeach unless something undisputable occurs, that can be easily explained to the public by Dems, and shows clear impeachable actions.  While his emoluments crap is serious stuff in reality, I question the ability to sell it to the public as being an impeachable offence.    It was easy to show breaking in and stealing DNC files was a crime.  I think it would take indisputable evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, or perhaps something like that, to really get an impeachment going.

First noting the limited meaning of the term ''ministerial,'' the Court observed that ''[v]ery different is the duty of the President in the exercise of the power to see that the laws are faithfully executed, and among these laws the acts named in the bill. . . . The duty thus imposed on the President is in no just sense ministerial.
