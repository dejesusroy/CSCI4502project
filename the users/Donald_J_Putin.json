I loved both movies.  Both were heavy, had some real despair and moving moments, and a bittersweet ending.  \n\nCasey Affleck had an amazing performance of someone who was emotionally destroyed by his past.  He conveyed that guilt and resignation, regret, and wanting to punished.  \n\nMoonlight really shared some great performers among a bunch of actors (my favorite being the drug dealer in the first act, the guy from House of Cards and 4400 - that guy has really improved!).  But Afleck really heald a performance through all stages of his grief, which I give a bit more admiration to.  \n\nBoth were great movies, but perhaps being a white catholic guy from the NE gave me a bit more of an ability to relate, versus a black gay male growing up in utter poverty.  \n\nBoth were able to tackle some really heavy and depressing events/lives without feeling utterly depressed at the end.  It wasn't sad for the sake of pulling the audience to tears, but more to show the beauty and pain of guilt and shame.\n\nI wouldn't be upset if either won best picture.  But I think Affleck has surpassed his brother as a lead, has more depth (and I still like Ben despite shit pop movies).  I really hope he gets the win.\n\nFor directing, its close, but Moonlight had more of a style to it that mixed pastel colors into the story in a way that was very immersive.  \n\nGood movie year - I just hope best picture doesn't go to Lala Land, which IMO was almost written to appeal to the Academy Awards by checking all the boxes that hollywood likes in a best picture.  It was good, but not great.  And personally, I left it not really having any of the songs stick with me.  the movie kinda peaks in the opening highway scene.","subreddit":"movies","author":"Donald_J_Putin","score":9,"link_id":"t3_5hi9i5","controversiality":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","retrieved_on":1486266363,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1485110138,"id":"dcrf8qu","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_dcr25ld"}{"link_id":"t3_5hi9i5","author_flair_css_class":null,"controversiality":0,"author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3s","retrieved_on":1486266429,"gilded":0,"stickied":false,"body":"What I liked was that it wasn't just depressing for the sake of moving the audience.
