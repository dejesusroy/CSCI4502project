He promised to bring his country back to greatness, to end their national humiliation, to bring it back to a glorious past when they were powerful and ethnically homogeneous.   The mainstream parties were in constant gridlock, nothing was getting done, the idea of compromise ceased to exist in the halls of power, so they wanted someone to cut through the mess.   And he used fancy new technology. A leader who spoke to people on the radio and not through stuffy written pronouncements? Whose speeches used loudspeakers so everyone could hear, not just the elites in the front? He was on the cutting edge.   And he was a regular guy. He wasn't a Von anything. He talked like the average German, not like one of those pompous Berlin aristocrats. He waved his hands around, got excited, like a real person, not a politician. Did he lie? Constantly, but nobody cared because he was enthusiastic about it.   Weren't the elites worried? Of course, but the mainstream conservatives made one of their own, Franz Von Papen, to be his Vice Chancellor. Surely Von Papen would rein in some of his more troubling instincts and get him to enact the conservative agenda.   He promised jobs and wealth and everything they wanted, and all they needed to do was give him the power to iron out all the...impurities that had degraded the country.
