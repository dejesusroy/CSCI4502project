The steel tariff fiasco is a good example of this.  >> As a result of a Section 201 (“safeguard”) investigation brought at the behest of the U.S. steel industry, President Bush in March 2002 imposed tariffs on imports of certain steel products for three years and one day. The tariffs, combined with other challenges present in the marketplace at the time and in the months that followed, boosted steel costs to the detriment of American companies that use steel to produce goods in the United States. The resulting negative impact included job losses for thousands of American workers. The Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition (CITAC) Foundation requested a formal examination of the impact of higher steel costs on American steel-consuming industries,1 and in particular, a quantification of employment losses at those companies. This study employed straight-forward and widelyaccepted regression analysis using a variety of price and employment data to maximize the reliability of the results.2 We found that: • 200,000 Americans lost their jobs to higher steel prices during 2002. These lost jobs represent approximately $4 billion in lost wages from February to November 2002.3 • One out of four (50,000) of these job losses occurred in the metal manufacturing, machinery and equipment and transportation equipment and parts sectors. • Job losses escalated steadily over 2002, peaking in November (at 202,000 jobs), and slightly declining to 197,000 jobs in December.4 • More American workers lost their jobs in 2002 to higher steel prices than the total number employed by the U.S. steel industry itself (187,500 Americans were employed by U.S. steel producers in December 2002).  So yeah.    >> Trump has a point with this. Our trade deals do need to be changed to incentivize US production.  No he doesn't, and no we don't.

NAFTA also has had little effect on the U.S. labor market. These results confirm the consensus opinion of economists at the time of the debate.

We find that Mexico's welfare increases by 1.31%, U.S.'s welfare increases by 0.08%, and Canada's welfare declines by 0.06%. We find that intra-bloc trade increases by 118% for Mexico, 11% for Canada and 41% for the U.S. We show that welfare effects from tariff reductions are reduced when the structure of production does not take into account intermediate goods or input-output linkages.

Brower of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal and Sadie Blanchard of Yale Law School published an article in the Columbia Journal of Transnational law outlining various common myths regarding ISDS. They assert that the balance of power created by international arbitration mechanisms is not nearly as asymmetric as its opponents would allege. They found that tribunals under the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) have ruled in favour of investors in 46% of cases and have typically granted less than 40% of the damages initially sought. This does not indicate any form of systemic bias in favour of investors in international arbitration courts.  >> Additionally, governments possess a wide variety of tools to sanction breaches by investors. Aside from civil damages, governments may also seek criminal sanctions in their own courts. Expropriation of assets may also serve as an enforcement tool for wronged governments. Conversely, in developing countries with politicized judicial systems, arbitration tribunals established by trade agreements often serve as investors’ only recourse in recovering damages from governments.  >> Brower and Blanchard deconstruct allegations of ISDS eroding national sovereignty by pointing out that limiting the scope of legitimate state action is precisely the purpose of international treaties. Criticisms of this type made with respect to ISDS may be equally applied to all international conventions that include enforcement mechanisms, without which they are effectively toothless. Concerns regarding the content that is being enforced may be entirely valid. However, the mere presence of an enforcement mechanism should not be viewed as a point against the TPP.  >> The authors of the article also state that ISDS is highly unlikely to interfere with the imposition of environmental regulations that reduce the return on certain investments. Not a single environmental regulation has been struck down via ISDS as of the time of writing, and no damages have been awarded to investors pursuant to a claim regarding the enforcement of an environmental law.

It is no one's responsibility but the student to pay for their loans. I don't believe in state-sponsored charity. It's a direct infringement of property rights to force someone to give their capital to something I do not want to give it to.  That's awesome, in the rational world we're interested in improving society. Education improves society, access to education improves society.  PS: You have no right to your pretax income, so your argument makes no sense.    >> There is zero logical or scientific differentiation between a fetus and a person with rights.  One is a lump of cells, one is a person. By your logic, there's nothing different between a tumor and a person with rights.    >> An organism is declared dead when they have no cellular processes and they have no internal homeostasis. This is when rights are revoked. The logical contrapositive states that all beings with cellular reproduction and homeostasis are given rights. This means fetsus's as well. What scientifically separates a fetus from a human person that makes the fetus's rights null and void?  The fact a fetus is not a person, it is a lump of cells, a parasite. It has no rights because it is not a person on any level, it's a potential person. I'm not itnerested in debating someone that thinks their religious fairy tale has a right to control other peoples bodies.    >> 4) The one where mishandling classified information is punishable with fines or jail time. And don't give me this ""BUT THE FBI SAID..."" because the government does not determine guilt. Action does. Just because the government said someone didn't do something doesn't make it true.   Yeah, you're dumb.  https://warontherocks.com/2016/07/why-intent-not-gross-negligence-is-the-standard-in-clinton-case/  Mishandling classified information via negligence is not actually a civilian criminal offense. I'll tell you what, go find me a single civilian ever charged with 793f using a negilegence theory.  Also, what the fuck? You said she broke federal law, the government decides federal law.   >> Of course, an unprovable statement to single out another voting bloc.  The man speaks at a 3rd grade level and has gone on the Alex Jones show.  He's displayed he has no idea what he's talking about on even a basic level.  He's spewing economic illiteracy and attacking our allies. In what universe does this person have any business in the white house?   >> Then why are you disputing it?

Not all rural people voted for Trump. So your statement is false.  I hate Trump voting rural people, or 90% of rural people.  >> Why do I have to give a shit about society? I care about me, my family, and friends. I don't care about anyone elses' education. I am not responsible for that at all. Why should I be required to pay for it? You just hate freedom.  No, I just enjoy a functioning society. And society disagrees with you.  But hey, you're more than free to move up into the mountains and you won't be locked down anymore.  Nobody is keeping you in society. You stay because you enjoy the comfort of society.  >> You are a lump of cells. How do you measure personhood and how can you attribute it to all human organisms... except for a fetus? It's arbitrary, unscientific, and illogical.   There's a difference between a lump of cells and a person. I'm not interested in having this debate with you.  Pro-lifers are the 9/11 truthers of the tard world and I'm not going to sit here and try to convince you that a lump of cells is different than a person.  >> Then what is a person, and what isn't? What scientific law or authority do you claim ""personhood"" be measured and catelogued? At what point is """"""""personhood"""""""" achieved and why? I didn't bring religion into this at all. This is a purely scientific, biological argument.   No, it's not. The authority was given by the supreme court actually, which has clearly stated a fetus is not a person.  Your personal opinion is not relevant, you are not a moral authority with the right to enforce your trash views on other people.  https://www.princeton.edu/~prolife/articles/wdhbb.html  But here you go.  The argument over when a fetus is a person is not a scientific question.  >> I've seen this argument used a lot, and it;s faulty at best. As a matter of fact, someone within the comments section rightfully points it out:  No, he did not,  This lie over deleted emails is one of the most common.  You'll see why below.   >> She violated provisions of the Federal Records Act that forbid public employees from holding or storing classified information in unauthorized places, media or networks.  No, she did not.  http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/02/396823014/fact-check-hillary-clinton-those-emails-and-the-law  >> ""A State Department spokeswoman says Hillary Clinton did not break any rules by relying solely on her personal email account. Federal law allows government officials to use personal email so long as relevant documents are preserved for history.""   >> **The law was amended in late 2014 to require that personal emails be transferred to government servers within 20 days. But that was after Clinton left office. Watchdog groups conceded that she may not have violated the text of the law, but they argue she violated the spirit of it. The Sunlight Foundation's John Wonderlich explained to Horsley:**    So right here you can see the problem.   >> Even if one accepts the argument that intent is dispositive in a decision to indict, how in the world could her setting up a personal email system and then subsequently deleting 33000+ emails when the existence of that server was discovered, NOT indicate intent to evade the laws that govern information security and transparency requirements for public officials?""  Oh, that's easy, you don't understand what the word intent means in relation to this law.  **Intent** in relation to these laws means intended to benefit another country.   >> Anyone who points to Code 783(f) completely disregards the other actions Clinton was responsible for when dealing with her server.  I'm not, but the other things you've given here are not accurate. You're claiming Clinton violated a law that didn't even exist before she left office.  There's a reason the legal consensus was she couldn't be charged for months in advance, it's because nothing she did was actually illegal.   >> **The bottom line is this: No one will likely ever know what was deleted from Clinton's server. Barring one of the 30,000 emails Clinton turned over to the State Department being deemed ""classified,"" it's also unlikely she will ever be found to have violated the letter of the law.**  ",FALSE,0
