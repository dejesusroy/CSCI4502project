The republican states refused to take federal funds, that's why you saw people forced to pay for insurance they couldn't actually afford.  Basically, the republicans decided Obamacare couldn't work, so they made it not work, and it still reduced premium growth and increased the insured rate.  People in Europe have a hard time understanding this, but conservatives here are literally retarded people.  It's not just political bias on my part, they literally do not want the government to function, they do not want people to have access to healthcare or anything like that.  They aren't like conservatives in Europe that want a strong country, they want a weak country.  They run around bitching about entitlements and welfare, the kicker? They're the ones that use the most welfare, the democrats fucking pay for everything.  https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2016/11/29/another-clinton-trump-divide-high-output-america-vs-low-output-america/  American conservatism is more about opposing literally anything liberals suggest than about running the country, it doesn't matter what the facts say.  That's why you see them denying climate change, evolution, and trying to push creationism into schools. They're just religious crazies with low mental capacity on average.  I tell anyone with the means to get the fuck out of this country, it's a dumpster fire.

Since then, as a country, Canadians have made a conscious decision to hold down costs. One of the ways they do that is by limiting supply, mostly for elective things, which can create wait times. Their outcomes are otherwise comparable to ours.  >> Please understand, the wait times could be overcome. Canadians could spend more. They don’t want to. We can choose to dislike wait times in principle, but they are a byproduct of Canada’s choice to be fiscally conservative.  >> Yes, they chose this.

In 2008, the Democrats held a majority in the statehouse of 53-46. What RedMap does is they identify and target six specific statehouse seats. They spend $1 million on these races, which is an unheard of amount of money coming into a statehouse race. Republicans win five of these. They take control of the Statehouse in Ohio - also, the state Senate that year. And it gives them, essentially, a veto-proof run of the entire re-districting in the state.**  >> **So in 2012, when Barack Obama wins again and he wins Ohio again, and Sherrod Brown is re-elected to the Senate by 325,000 votes, the Democrats get more votes in statehouse races than the Republicans. But the lines were drawn so perfectly that the Republicans held a 60-39 supermajority in the House of Representatives, despite having fewer votes.**   The people running the GOP aren't stupid, they aren't uneducated. Their base is, and they're better at manipulating that base.  >> Gerrymandering doesn't account for the complete collapse of the party. Sorry but take a look again at the article I linked. The losses were not only in the house but also the senate as well as in state legislatures and governors. That's not gerrymandering. That's just getting your ass kicked.   The senate was never going to stay under dermocratic control, 17% of the country can elect a senate majority, the DNC wins the popular vote nationally in senate races.   >> In conclusion, it appears that despite the superior intellect, education, and output the Democrats haven't yet figured out how to win elections so enjoy being ruled by a bunch of dumbass Republicans for the next 4-8 years.

The steel tariff fiasco is a good example of this.  >> As a result of a Section 201 (“safeguard”) investigation brought at the behest of the U.S. steel industry, President Bush in March 2002 imposed tariffs on imports of certain steel products for three years and one day. The tariffs, combined with other challenges present in the marketplace at the time and in the months that followed, boosted steel costs to the detriment of American companies that use steel to produce goods in the United States. The resulting negative impact included job losses for thousands of American workers. The Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition (CITAC) Foundation requested a formal examination of the impact of higher steel costs on American steel-consuming industries,1 and in particular, a quantification of employment losses at those companies. This study employed straight-forward and widelyaccepted regression analysis using a variety of price and employment data to maximize the reliability of the results.2 We found that: • 200,000 Americans lost their jobs to higher steel prices during 2002. These lost jobs represent approximately $4 billion in lost wages from February to November 2002.3 • One out of four (50,000) of these job losses occurred in the metal manufacturing, machinery and equipment and transportation equipment and parts sectors. • Job losses escalated steadily over 2002, peaking in November (at 202,000 jobs), and slightly declining to 197,000 jobs in December.4 • More American workers lost their jobs in 2002 to higher steel prices than the total number employed by the U.S. steel industry itself (187,500 Americans were employed by U.S. steel producers in December 2002).  So yeah.    >> Trump has a point with this. Our trade deals do need to be changed to incentivize US production.  No he doesn't, and no we don't.

To evaluate these arguments, we analyze recent trade data and survey post-NAFTA studies. We find that both the U.S. and Mexico benefit from NAFTA, with much larger relative benefits for Mexico. NAFTA also has had little effect on the U.S. labor market. These results confirm the consensus opinion of economists at the time of the debate. Finally, studies find that trade creation greatly exceeds trade diversion in the region under NAFTA, especially in intermediate goods.**   And even more:  http://bigstory.ap.org/article/265cd8fb02fb44a69cf0eaa2063e11d9/mexico-taking-us-factory-jobs-blame-robots-instead  >> But research shows that the automation of U.S. factories is a much bigger factor than foreign trade in the loss of factory jobs.

The vast majority of the lost jobs — 88 percent — were taken by robots and other homegrown factors that reduce factories' need for human labor.  >> ""We're making more with fewer people,"" says Howard Shatz, a senior economist at the Rand Corp. think tank. General Motors, for instance, now employs barely a third of the 600,000 workers it had in the 1970s.

We also propose a new method to estimate sectoral trade elasticities consistent with any trade model that delivers a multiplicative gravity equation. We apply our model and use our estimated elasticities to identify the impact of NAFTA's tariff reductions. We find that Mexico's welfare increases by 1.31%, U.S.'s welfare increases by 0.08%, and Canada's welfare declines by 0.06%. We find that intra-bloc trade increases by 118% for Mexico, 11% for Canada and 41% for the U.S. We show that welfare effects from tariff reductions are reduced when the structure of production does not take into account intermediate goods or input-output linkages.

Brower of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal and Sadie Blanchard of Yale Law School published an article in the Columbia Journal of Transnational law outlining various common myths regarding ISDS. They assert that the balance of power created by international arbitration mechanisms is not nearly as asymmetric as its opponents would allege. They found that tribunals under the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) have ruled in favour of investors in 46% of cases and have typically granted less than 40% of the damages initially sought. This does not indicate any form of systemic bias in favour of investors in international arbitration courts.  >> Additionally, governments possess a wide variety of tools to sanction breaches by investors. Aside from civil damages, governments may also seek criminal sanctions in their own courts. Expropriation of assets may also serve as an enforcement tool for wronged governments. Conversely, in developing countries with politicized judicial systems, arbitration tribunals established by trade agreements often serve as investors’ only recourse in recovering damages from governments.  >> Brower and Blanchard deconstruct allegations of ISDS eroding national sovereignty by pointing out that limiting the scope of legitimate state action is precisely the purpose of international treaties. Criticisms of this type made with respect to ISDS may be equally applied to all international conventions that include enforcement mechanisms, without which they are effectively toothless. Concerns regarding the content that is being enforced may be entirely valid. However, the mere presence of an enforcement mechanism should not be viewed as a point against the TPP.  >> The authors of the article also state that ISDS is highly unlikely to interfere with the imposition of environmental regulations that reduce the return on certain investments. Not a single environmental regulation has been struck down via ISDS as of the time of writing, and no damages have been awarded to investors pursuant to a claim regarding the enforcement of an environmental law.

I also said those numbers in the absence of how they are derived and the TOTAL GDP are silly. If U.S. manufacturing grew 4 times the base amount, and total GDP grew 6 times--then its shrunk RELATIVE to the total economy even though its grown in absolute.   Manufacturing in terms of value was on a steady increase, the increase never changed. So your argument doesn't really make sense.  It never slowed down. The jobs did, manufacturing didn't. You can keep going back, manufacturing jobs were on a slow decline for years.  >> And? The global economy has done nothing but increase in terms of value. Global GDP has grown by an absorbent amount. As I said above, there are a lot more customers, there is a lot more wealth--but we're producing much less of it. Part of that is because our trade deals hamper our growth.  See above.  This also doesn't make sense. The US got a huge advantage after ww2 because of the rest of the world got bombed out, we were something like 50% of world output at one point.  That was never going to last, clearly, we actually have to compete now. The US is like 25% of the worlds manufacturing output currently and 5% of the world's population.

Therefore, we can conclude that the declining share of manufacturing’s contribution to GDP is not unique to America, but reflects a global trend as the world moves from a traditional manufacturing-intensive “Machine Age” economy to more a services-intensive “Information Age” economy.**  This obsession with manufacturing is just cringe.     >> How is it delusional to point out GDP and trade deficits?

It’s a sign that advances in manufacturing productivity and efficiency are translating into lower prices for consumers when they purchase things like cars, food, clothing, appliances, furniture, and electronic goods. In the U.S., the price of goods relative to services fell by 52 percent between 1970 and 2010, so it’s not surprising that manufacturing’s importance in the economy has fallen significantly.**  >> **As spending on manufactured goods as a share of household income declines, it raises our standard of living, and for that “decline in manufacturing” we should celebrate, not complain.**         Sorry, you lose.

The vast majority of the lost jobs — 88 percent — were taken by robots and other homegrown factors that reduce factories' need for human labor.

Also, taking away rights from people you hate is not at all justified.  **Was clearly a joke.**  This sub is like the right wing SRS.   >> That isn't a strawman. By definition, Trump supporters oppose Clinton. Those who opposed her enough to bite the bullet for Trump are on your hate list.  It was blatantly a strawman.    >> As a pro-lifer who advocates for individual human freedom over government intervention, I vehemently disagree.  - Anti-choice  - Values individual freedom.  - Wants to take rights from people.   >> 2) I don't care if it benefits anyone. It is no one's responsibility but the student to pay for their loans. I don't believe in state-sponsored charity. It's a direct infringement of property rights to force someone to give their capital to something I do not want to give it to.  That's awesome, in the rational world we're interested in improving society. Education improves society, access to education improves society.  PS: You have no right to your pretax income, so your argument makes no sense.    >> There is zero logical or scientific differentiation between a fetus and a person with rights.  One is a lump of cells, one is a person. By your logic, there's nothing different between a tumor and a person with rights.    >> An organism is declared dead when they have no cellular processes and they have no internal homeostasis. This is when rights are revoked. The logical contrapositive states that all beings with cellular reproduction and homeostasis are given rights. This means fetsus's as well. What scientifically separates a fetus from a human person that makes the fetus's rights null and void?  The fact a fetus is not a person, it is a lump of cells, a parasite. It has no rights because it is not a person on any level, it's a potential person. I'm not itnerested in debating someone that thinks their religious fairy tale has a right to control other peoples bodies.    >> 4) The one where mishandling classified information is punishable with fines or jail time. And don't give me this ""BUT THE FBI SAID..."" because the government does not determine guilt. Action does. Just because the government said someone didn't do something doesn't make it true.   Yeah, you're dumb.  https://warontherocks.com/2016/07/why-intent-not-gross-negligence-is-the-standard-in-clinton-case/  Mishandling classified information via negligence is not actually a civilian criminal offense. I'll tell you what, go find me a single civilian ever charged with 793f using a negilegence theory.  Also, what the fuck? You said she broke federal law, the government decides federal law.   >> Of course, an unprovable statement to single out another voting bloc.  The man speaks at a 3rd grade level and has gone on the Alex Jones show.  He's displayed he has no idea what he's talking about on even a basic level.  He's spewing economic illiteracy and attacking our allies. In what universe does this person have any business in the white house?   >> Then why are you disputing it? Just admit it was a stupid statement and we can be done here.  I'm not disputing the statement. I'm disputing these garbage arguments in relation to race and nothing else.

Not all rural people voted for Trump. So your statement is false.  I hate Trump voting rural people, or 90% of rural people.  >> Why do I have to give a shit about society? I care about me, my family, and friends. I don't care about anyone elses' education. I am not responsible for that at all. Why should I be required to pay for it? You just hate freedom.  No, I just enjoy a functioning society. And society disagrees with you.  But hey, you're more than free to move up into the mountains and you won't be locked down anymore.  Nobody is keeping you in society. You stay because you enjoy the comfort of society.  >> You are a lump of cells. How do you measure personhood and how can you attribute it to all human organisms... except for a fetus? It's arbitrary, unscientific, and illogical.   There's a difference between a lump of cells and a person. I'm not interested in having this debate with you.  Pro-lifers are the 9/11 truthers of the tard world and I'm not going to sit here and try to convince you that a lump of cells is different than a person.  >> Then what is a person, and what isn't? What scientific law or authority do you claim ""personhood"" be measured and catelogued? At what point is """"""""personhood"""""""" achieved and why? I didn't bring religion into this at all. This is a purely scientific, biological argument.   No, it's not. The authority was given by the supreme court actually, which has clearly stated a fetus is not a person.  Your personal opinion is not relevant, you are not a moral authority with the right to enforce your trash views on other people.  https://www.princeton.edu/~prolife/articles/wdhbb.html  But here you go.  The argument over when a fetus is a person is not a scientific question.  >> I've seen this argument used a lot, and it;s faulty at best. As a matter of fact, someone within the comments section rightfully points it out:  No, he did not,  This lie over deleted emails is one of the most common.  You'll see why below.   >> She violated provisions of the Federal Records Act that forbid public employees from holding or storing classified information in unauthorized places, media or networks.  No, she did not.  http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/02/396823014/fact-check-hillary-clinton-those-emails-and-the-law  >> ""A State Department spokeswoman says Hillary Clinton did not break any rules by relying solely on her personal email account. Federal law allows government officials to use personal email so long as relevant documents are preserved for history.""   >> **The law was amended in late 2014 to require that personal emails be transferred to government servers within 20 days. But that was after Clinton left office. Watchdog groups conceded that she may not have violated the text of the law, but they argue she violated the spirit of it. The Sunlight Foundation's John Wonderlich explained to Horsley:**    So right here you can see the problem.   >> Even if one accepts the argument that intent is dispositive in a decision to indict, how in the world could her setting up a personal email system and then subsequently deleting 33000+ emails when the existence of that server was discovered, NOT indicate intent to evade the laws that govern information security and transparency requirements for public officials?""  Oh, that's easy, you don't understand what the word intent means in relation to this law.  **Intent** in relation to these laws means intended to benefit another country.   >> Anyone who points to Code 783(f) completely disregards the other actions Clinton was responsible for when dealing with her server.  I'm not, but the other things you've given here are not accurate. You're claiming Clinton violated a law that didn't even exist before she left office.  There's a reason the legal consensus was she couldn't be charged for months in advance, it's because nothing she did was actually illegal.   >> **The bottom line is this: No one will likely ever know what was deleted from Clinton's server. Barring one of the 30,000 emails Clinton turned over to the State Department being deemed ""classified,"" it's also unlikely she will ever be found to have violated the letter of the law.**  ","ShitPoliticsSays","t1_dd48o4r","dd49k3w","1485816451","1485816090","null"
