The argument is exit polls are wrong because of the line shap but that's false because it makes sense that the lines go way up because Clinton only won cities which is partly why she lost the General.   She did awful with rural voters if primary was decided by rural voters (which would be better) he would be the nominee.

I have no idea what it says and I am not going to guess until there is conclusive evidence.   But wasn't the primary polls more accurate then the generals?   General were way off but not counting exit polls primary seemed line that polls were decent. ","-1","kiarra33","t3_5r9i7n","t5_3ff8l","1486599441","","Concerned Canadian is very concerned","0"
"1485904119","null","t1_dd5yrti","dd5yznw","False","WayOfTheBern","False","0","Yeah both General and primary exit polls were off.   In Ohio 200,000 voters were purged from the rolls probably having to cast a provisional ballot, these were mostly students.  In CA I belive the exit poll was right? On CA they actually count provisionals.   NY there was the voter purge but even if you count all those provisionals the exit poll is still way off so no idea what Happened. NC and FL were spot on for the primary but off for the general.  Yeah have no idea why exit polls were so bad.
