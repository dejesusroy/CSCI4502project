In Ohio 200,000 voters were purged from the rolls probably having to cast a provisional ballot, these were mostly students.  In CA I belive the exit poll was right? On CA they actually count provisionals.   NY there was the voter purge but even if you count all those provisionals the exit poll is still way off so no idea what Happened. NC and FL were spot on for the primary but off for the general.  Yeah have no idea why exit polls were so bad. ",FALSE,0
