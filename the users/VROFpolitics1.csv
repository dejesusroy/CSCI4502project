It is hard to sit here in California and hurt for the women in Texas who are forced to deliver stillborn babies because of their horrific laws, or people in coal states who are suffering from black lung, or the people in North Carolina who have to wait in line for hours just to vote; and then watch as those people keep voting for the exact, same representation that is causing them this harm.   When this is all over California will be fine. We might have a few bumps, but it is possible that we will come out even better. Our state already has many of the things Hillary Clinton wanted for America (affordable college, paid family leave, higher minimum wage) and we have had them for a long time so we aren't going to suffer. But I'm not going to worry about the suffering in the states that vote for more suffering for themselves.

But the savvy Virginian James Madison responded that such a system would prove unacceptable to the South: “The right of suffrage was much more diffusive [i.e., extensive] in the Northern than the Southern States; and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of Negroes.” In other words, in a direct election system, the North would outnumber the South, whose many slaves (more than half a million in all) of course could not vote. But the Electoral College—a prototype of which Madison proposed in this same speech—instead let each southern state count its slaves, albeit with a two-fifths discount, in computing its share of the overall count.  >Virginia emerged as the big winner—the California of the Founding era—with 12 out of a total of 91 electoral votes allocated by the Philadelphia Constitution, more than a quarter of the 46 needed to win an election in the first round. After the 1800 census, Wilson’s free state of Pennsylvania had 10% more free persons than Virginia, but got 20% fewer electoral votes. Perversely, the more slaves Virginia (or any other slave state) bought or bred, the more electoral votes it would receive. Were a slave state to free any blacks who then moved North, the state could actually lose electoral votes.  >**If the system’s pro-slavery tilt was not overwhelmingly obvious when the Constitution was ratified, it quickly became so. For 32 of the Constitution’s first 36 years, a white slaveholding Virginian occupied the presidency.**","politics","null","0","null","t5_2cneq","1486037311","t3_5ntxzo","null","1484375480","dceqwbo","False","t1_dcehidq"
