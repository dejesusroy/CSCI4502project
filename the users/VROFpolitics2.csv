If you live in a red state, then I'm sorry, you get the education system you vote for.   I live in California. We have affordable college here. Our community colleges are a cheap pathway to our UC system where tuition is a bargain at around $15,000 a year and if parents are middle class that goes down considerably and is free if your family makes under $80,000 a year. Tuition for our CSUs is around $7,000 a year and community college is a pathway to those colleges too. The Cal Grants are also available for middle class families and make attending affordable.   These colleges are filled with students who are coming from our public schools. My nephew attended a prestigious private school, got great grades and wasn't accepted to any UCs. Our public schools are fantastic.   Do we have some failures? Yes. Oakland would be a prime example but Los Angeles isn't that great either. My first-hand experience with public school was for the most part outstanding. My kids attended neighborhood public schools and received many scholarships and grants and currently attend our public universities. I wasn't thrilled with some of their high school teachers, but the public Community College allowed them to take up to 11 units for $39 a semester so they didn't take the AP route and graduated from high school with many college credits completed. The public high school helped make a schedule that accommodated this pathway.   This myth that our public schools are terrible is not helpful. Giving tax money to private schools is a bad idea. I'm not even very impressed with charter schools for the most part. Especially what I have seen in Oakland. ","0","politics","VROF","28","t1_dcloheb","dclp0ol","False","1484776958","null"

Her plan and positions were available on her website. So anyone who was getting their news from Facebook had the information they supposedly didn't have only a few clicks away.   But none of that matters. Because the argument of ""uninspiring"" (are you fucking kidding me?), or ""not Trump"" are ridiculous. ""Not Trump"" should have been enough. Your criticism that ""Hillary only adopted any of the things"" I mentioned because of Bernie Sanders is pathetic. So what? Isn't that what we want of our politicians?

Mitch Daniels was liked because he focused almost exclusively on the economy and government efficiency. He gave no fucks about social issues, and it was implied that Pence, as the successor of Daniels, would set aside the social dogmas that he was known for and govern a state that was on a very good path, economically, after Mitch Daniels' two terms.  He didn't do that.   From day one, Pence didn't govern--he played national GOP politics. Whatever the big firey debate of the day was among the national GOP, he grabbed ahold of it and pretended to be its conservative crusader, even if it had absolutely zero relevance to the state of Indiana. He spent time, money, and resources on championing issues that Hoosiers didn't care about or didn't support, because he wanted to pander to the National GOP's ultra conservative base for his future career. Essentially, he was using Indiana as a stepping stone. He never cared about being governor. He always had higher aspirations, and the governorship was a stepping stone to a higher federal office. Most Hoosiers, left or right on the political spectrum, espouse this opinion about him.  As I said before, Mitch Daniels literally gave no fucks about social issues. Indiana is generally a conservative state, but it's never been a state particularly hung up on social issues, and it's never been a state that follows the national GOP's social platform. Indiana has, for as long as I've been alive, been a business Republican state--politicians like the Bushes, Mitt Romney, etc. We voted Obama into office, and prior to Mitch Daniels in 2005, we had 16 straight years of Democratic governorship. Indianapolis, the capital and largest city in the state, routinely switched between Republican and Democrat mayors, and it has managed to have long-term plans and continue its momentum regardless of which party is in office.  So Pence, with his national conservative GOP politics, has been an aberration that has directly harmed Indiana's image and its pocket book.   In the three years since Pence took office, he:  * Pushed through legislation making harsher penalties for drug crimes against the protests of numerous major legal organizations including the Indiana Bar Association, as well as most Hoosiers  * Inherited a phenomenal state balance sheet from Mitch Daniels and used it as an excuse to push tax cuts so extreme (would have caused a tremendous deficit) that the Republican-controlled Congress shut him down  * Tried and failed to amend the Indiana constitution to ban gay marriage, despite widespread polling that showed that Hoosiers didn't support it, and despite the vociferous condemnation of virtually every major business in the state  * Since his gay marriage amendment failed, he literally, as payback (not exaggerating, the signing ceremony was invite only, no media was allowed or invited, but someone leaked a picture that showed Pence surrounded by well-known anti-LGBT extremists), came back with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act which was a genuine political circus. It humiliated Indiana on the national stage, directly harmed Indianapolis, and was met with, perhaps, the fiercest backlash by the people of any state in the Union. The extraordinary protests of Hoosiers and businesses allowed the state GOP leaders to basically coerce--to his visible chagrin--Pence to amend the law and ""fix it"" (this was actually the [front page](http://media.theindychannel.com/photo/2015/03/31/indy_star_fix_this_now_1427838279029_15914269_ver1.0_640_480.jpg) of the biggest newspaper in Indiana).   * The RFRA was such a debacle that Pence ended up hiring an expensive out-of-state public relations firm to heal Indiana's national image. He couldn't answer why he chose an out-of-state firm. He couldn't answer why he chose such an expensive firm, when there are many firms in Indiana that could have done the job. It was eventually canceled, and was yet another waste of taxpayer money. To date, the RFRA has cost Indianapolis (a city that fought against it, changed the official tourism website to rainbow colors, and hung a huge rainbow banner at the airport) $60 million, and the total cost--to the economy and reputation--to the rest of the state is unknown.   * During the gay marriage supreme court fight, he literally sent the Indiana attorney general to *other states* to advise them on how to craft their laws and fight gay marriage nationally. He did this on the taxpayer dollar. He continued to spend taxpayer money fighting gay marriage in the courts and with lawsuits despite, at the time, everyone knowing what the Supreme Court decision was going to be. It was basically a political stand by Pence; an expensive political stand that Hoosiers didn't support.  * He fought to pass a law preventing cities from passing their own minimum wage statutes. Is this ""small government""?   * He has acted like a strongman (think Turkey's Erdoğan), doing everything in his power to make Glenda Ritz, the state superintendent **and an elected official**, quit her job, and barring that, stripping her of the power given to her by the Indiana constitute and the Hoosiers that elected her through backroom deals, conspiracy, and highly technical legal challenges. Just Google ""Mike Pence Glenda Ritz."" You could write a thesis on it.   * Everyone, literally everyone, was on board for receiving a *huge* federal grant for preschool funding. The Indiana Department of Education was literally in the final stages of the application process--and the federal government was happy with Indiana and going to give us an especially large chunk of money--when Pence came in and shut it down for no reason because accepting money from the feds became politically untenable among the national GOP tea partier crowd. And, of course, you can't be elected president--Pence's eyes were always on the future--without support from the GOP's far right base. After shutting down the process, he has recently been opining that it would be a good idea to get federal money to fund preschools... A year after he shit all over the Dept of Education's proposal to do just that.   * The HIV epidemic in southern Indiana is out of control and among the worst in the country. Of course, we could provide free needles for heroin addicts like has been done in many states to curb HIV problems, but that is politically repugnant to Mike Pence. He also managed to get the Planned Parenthoods in that part of the state shut down, eliminating the opportunity for poor people to get tested. The HIV epidemic, which never had to be an epidemic, continues, and Pence gets to push the problem on our future governor as he goes to join Trump on the national stage.   * Speaking of Planned Parenthood, Pence is highly proud of his accomplishment at passing the single most restrictive abortion law since Roe vs Wade. The law, HEA 1337 is far stricter than anything even in the Deep South and is almost certainly unconstitutional. He knows that it's probably unconstitutional. Nevertheless, Indiana taxpayers will spend millions of dollars for our attorney general to fight the law all the way to the Supreme Court, just so Pence could make his political statement.   * He literally tried to make a state-run news agency that he would then give exclusive interviews and access to. I don't even know if that's legal, but he tried to do it and was promptly crucified by the media and even his own party.   * He asserted authority to ban Syrian refugees from being settled in Indiana. He has no authority. No governor has. He knew that, but he was planning to be a GOP presidential candidate, and he needed to show that he was strong and anti-Muslim refugee to appease the national GOP base. He took leadership role in this discriminatory crusade, appearing on national TV to preach his ignorance. This particular event managed to throw multiple refugee settlement organizations into disarray--which, by the way, actually include the Catholic Church of Indiana (the arch bishop of Indianapolis publicly criticized the governor)--and several Syrian refugees which were well into the process of moving to Indiana had to be relocated to another state. Pence didn't back down until the courts affirmed that his order was unconstitutional.  * He shut down a highly successful energy efficiency program--one of the first in the nation, making Indiana a trailblazer--initiated by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission with the support of previous governor Mitch Daniels. He did this for no good reason, other than to signal to his far-right constituents that he was fighting against Obama's evil despotic EPA.   This is all just in his three years in office. He is reviled across the state, and especially so in Indianapolis. There is (was--now that he's the VP nominee, he can no longer be governor) a bipartisan *Pence Must Go* campaign to get rid of him, and there are literally [billboards](http://media1.fdncms.com/nuvo/imager/u/original/3821872/pmg_billboard.jpg) and [yard signs](http://media.theindychannel.com/photo/2015/04/17/16x9/_Fire_Pence__signs_go_up_after_RFRA_2839710000_16967639_ver1.0_640_480.jpg) plastered all over the city. Pence is, by virtually all objective measures, one of the worst governors in recent Indiana history, at least in terms of working for the benefit of the state. He has basically focused on far-right Christian social conservative interests to the clear detriment of all else, most importantly the current and future well-being of the state's reputation and economy.

[It was created to give slave states a bigger influence](http://time.com/4558510/electoral-college-history-slavery/) because a huge segment of their population wasn't allowed to vote.   >At the Philadelphia convention, the visionary Pennsylvanian James Wilson proposed direct national election of the president. But the savvy Virginian James Madison responded that such a system would prove unacceptable to the South: “The right of suffrage was much more diffusive [i.e., extensive] in the Northern than the Southern States; and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of Negroes.” In other words, in a direct election system, the North would outnumber the South, whose many slaves (more than half a million in all) of course could not vote. But the Electoral College—a prototype of which Madison proposed in this same speech—instead let each southern state count its slaves, albeit with a two-fifths discount, in computing its share of the overall count.  >Virginia emerged as the big winner—the California of the Founding era—with 12 out of a total of 91 electoral votes allocated by the Philadelphia Constitution, more than a quarter of the 46 needed to win an election in the first round. After the 1800 census, Wilson’s free state of Pennsylvania had 10% more free persons than Virginia, but got 20% fewer electoral votes. Perversely, the more slaves Virginia (or any other slave state) bought or bred, the more electoral votes it would receive. Were a slave state to free any blacks who then moved North, the state could actually lose electoral votes.  >**If the system’s pro-slavery tilt was not overwhelmingly obvious when the Constitution was ratified, it quickly became so. For 32 of the Constitution’s first 36 years, a white slaveholding Virginian occupied the presidency.**  That's unbelievable. Thanks.

""Let's say that Donald Trump basically makes whatever you want to say, whatever claim he wants to make. And everybody knows it's a falsehood. The big question of my audience, it is impossible for me to say that, 'By the way, you know it's false.' And they'll say, 'Why? I saw it on Allen B. West.' Or they'll say, 'I saw it on a Facebook page.' And I'll say, 'The New York Times did a fact check.' And they'll say, 'Oh, that's The New York Times. That's bulls---.' There's nobody — you can't go to anybody and say, 'Look, here are the facts.'""  >""And I have to say that's one of the disorienting realities of this political year. You can be in this alternative media reality and there's no way to break through it,"" Sykes continued. ""And I swim upstream because if I don't say these things from some of these websites, then suddenly I have sold out. Then they'll ask what's wrong with me for not repeating these stories that I know not to be true.""  >**""If you are a conservative talk show host, which I am, if you don't accept that it's likely Hillary Clinton has taken part in multiple murders, or that Barack Obama is a Muslim extremist sympathizer who was probably born outside this country — if you don't accept those two things, it's almost as if you're a sellout. You're a RINO. You're somehow part of the liberal elite. It's nuts. It's making my own show very difficult to do.

Of course, the whole purpose is to let the supporters have something to cling to. There was a great [Tweet from a former White House staffter](https://twitter.com/rascouet/status/823035518313267202) that explained what is happening here. I have transcribed it below:   If you are puzzled by the bizarre ""press conference"" put on by the White House press secretary this evening (angrily claiming that Trump's inauguration had the largest audience in history, accusing them of faking photos and lying about attendance), let me help explain it. This spectacle served three purposes:   1.  Establishing a norm with the press: they will be told things that are obviously wrong and they will have no opportunity to ask question.s. That way, they will be grateful if they get anything more at any press conference. This is the PR equivalent of ""negging,"" the odiou pick-up practice of a particular kind of horrible person (e.g., Donald Trump).  2.  Increasing the separation between Trump's base (1/3 of the population) from everybody else (the remaining 2/3). By being told something that is obviously wrong--that there is no evidence for and all evidence against, that anybody with eyes can see is wrong--they are forced to pick whether they are going to believe Trump or their lying eyes. The gamble here--likely to pay off--is that they will believe Trump. This means that they will regard media outlets that report the truth as ""fake news"" (because otherwise they'd be forced to confront their cognitive dissonance.)  3.  Creating a sense of uncertainty about whether facts are knowable, among a certain chunk of the population (which is taking a page from the Kremlin, for whom this is their preferred disinformation tactic). A third of the population will say ""clearly the White House is lying,"" a third will say ""if Trump says it, it must be true,"" and the remaining third will say ""gosh, I guess this is unknowable."" The idea isn't to convince these people of untrue things, it's to fatigue them, so that they will stay out of the political process entirely, regarding the truth as just too difficult to determine.   This is laying important groundwork for the months ahead. If Trump's White House is willing to lie about something as obviously, unquestionably fake as this, just imagine what else they'll lie about. In particular, things that the public cannot possibly verify the truth of. It's gonna get real bad. ","1","politics","VROF","708","t1_dcqlcky","dcqv73d","False","1485069350","null"

Try some chin-ups maybe and some pushups.’”  >“Essentially saying that he’s overweight?” host Candy Crowley asked.  >“No, essentially says this old retread can beat you any day of the week,” Brown answered.  >Back on August 27, Christie started a cross-country war of words at a Tampa, Fla. speech to California’s Republican National Convention delegates. In the address, he accused the state of making a “bad choice” by electing Brown, calling the governor an “old retread.”  And all these years later Jerry Brown has turned California into one of the largest economies in the world; and Chris Christie is too corrupt and terrible to even work in the Trump administration.

Any sitting politician who endorsed this man before, during, or after this campaign deserves to lose their job.  Donald Trump has been an unacceptable choice since day 1, since before we heard *any* of this, but they endorsed him anyway.  House and Senate Republicans were willing to risk the wellbeing of the American people, and nominate a madman, in an effort to preserve the appearance of party unity.  They care more about obeying the Eleventh Commandment than they do protecting their constituents.      What we heard today might very well be his last offensive comment, but it's certainly not his first.      #ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS THIS MAN IS WORKING AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  PERIOD.      Donald Trump didn't change tonight, he's still the same man he was when Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and Reince Priebus endorsed him.      It seems to me that congressional support for Trump is symptomatic of a much bigger problem within the GOP.      Is a Republican Congressman endorsing Donald Trump in the name of partisanship and party unity ***that substantially different*** from a Republican Governor turning down a fully funded Medicaid expansion just to spite Obama and the ACA?

The difference between being a representative and being a governor is as a representative, you push for your special interests, as a governor, you do what's best for your state.   Pence got the endorsement from the much-liked former Republican governor Mitch Daniels (now president of Purdue) basically with the promise that he wouldn't pursue a social agenda. Mitch Daniels was liked because he focused almost exclusively on the economy and government efficiency. He gave no fucks about social issues, and it was implied that Pence, as the successor of Daniels, would set aside the social dogmas that he was known for and govern a state that was on a very good path, economically, after Mitch Daniels' two terms.  He didn't do that.   From day one, Pence didn't govern--he played national GOP politics. Whatever the big firey debate of the day was among the national GOP, he grabbed ahold of it and pretended to be its conservative crusader, even if it had absolutely zero relevance to the state of Indiana. He spent time, money, and resources on championing issues that Hoosiers didn't care about or didn't support, because he wanted to pander to the National GOP's ultra conservative base for his future career. Essentially, he was using Indiana as a stepping stone. He never cared about being governor. He always had higher aspirations, and the governorship was a stepping stone to a higher federal office. Most Hoosiers, left or right on the political spectrum, espouse this opinion about him.  As I said before, Mitch Daniels literally gave no fucks about social issues. Indiana is generally a conservative state, but it's never been a state particularly hung up on social issues, and it's never been a state that follows the national GOP's social platform. Indiana has, for as long as I've been alive, been a business Republican state--politicians like the Bushes, Mitt Romney, etc. We voted Obama into office, and prior to Mitch Daniels in 2005, we had 16 straight years of Democratic governorship. Indianapolis, the capital and largest city in the state, routinely switched between Republican and Democrat mayors, and it has managed to have long-term plans and continue its momentum regardless of which party is in office.  So Pence, with his national conservative GOP politics, has been an aberration that has directly harmed Indiana's image and its pocket book.   In the three years since Pence took office, he:  * Pushed through legislation making harsher penalties for drug crimes against the protests of numerous major legal organizations including the Indiana Bar Association, as well as most Hoosiers  * Inherited a phenomenal state balance sheet from Mitch Daniels and used it as an excuse to push tax cuts so extreme (would have caused a tremendous deficit) that the Republican-controlled Congress shut him down  * Tried and failed to amend the Indiana constitution to ban gay marriage, despite widespread polling that showed that Hoosiers didn't support it, and despite the vociferous condemnation of virtually every major business in the state  * Since his gay marriage amendment failed, he literally, as payback (not exaggerating, the signing ceremony was invite only, no media was allowed or invited, but someone leaked a picture that showed Pence surrounded by well-known anti-LGBT extremists), came back with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act which was a genuine political circus. It humiliated Indiana on the national stage, directly harmed Indianapolis, and was met with, perhaps, the fiercest backlash by the people of any state in the Union. The extraordinary protests of Hoosiers and businesses allowed the state GOP leaders to basically coerce--to his visible chagrin--Pence to amend the law and ""fix it"" (this was actually the [front page](http://media.theindychannel.com/photo/2015/03/31/indy_star_fix_this_now_1427838279029_15914269_ver1.0_640_480.jpg) of the biggest newspaper in Indiana).   * The RFRA was such a debacle that Pence ended up hiring an expensive out-of-state public relations firm to heal Indiana's national image. He couldn't answer why he chose an out-of-state firm. He couldn't answer why he chose such an expensive firm, when there are many firms in Indiana that could have done the job. It was eventually canceled, and was yet another waste of taxpayer money. To date, the RFRA has cost Indianapolis (a city that fought against it, changed the official tourism website to rainbow colors, and hung a huge rainbow banner at the airport) $60 million, and the total cost--to the economy and reputation--to the rest of the state is unknown.   * During the gay marriage supreme court fight, he literally sent the Indiana attorney general to *other states* to advise them on how to craft their laws and fight gay marriage nationally. He did this on the taxpayer dollar. He continued to spend taxpayer money fighting gay marriage in the courts and with lawsuits despite, at the time, everyone knowing what the Supreme Court decision was going to be. It was basically a political stand by Pence; an expensive political stand that Hoosiers didn't support.  * He fought to pass a law preventing cities from passing their own minimum wage statutes. Is this ""small government""?   * He has acted like a strongman (think Turkey's Erdoğan), doing everything in his power to make Glenda Ritz, the state superintendent **and an elected official**, quit her job, and barring that, stripping her of the power given to her by the Indiana constitute and the Hoosiers that elected her through backroom deals, conspiracy, and highly technical legal challenges. Just Google ""Mike Pence Glenda Ritz."" You could write a thesis on it.   * Everyone, literally everyone, was on board for receiving a *huge* federal grant for preschool funding. The Indiana Department of Education was literally in the final stages of the application process--and the federal government was happy with Indiana and going to give us an especially large chunk of money--when Pence came in and shut it down for no reason because accepting money from the feds became politically untenable among the national GOP tea partier crowd. And, of course, you can't be elected president--Pence's eyes were always on the future--without support from the GOP's far right base. After shutting down the process, he has recently been opining that it would be a good idea to get federal money to fund preschools... A year after he shit all over the Dept of Education's proposal to do just that.   * The HIV epidemic in southern Indiana is out of control and among the worst in the country. Of course, we could provide free needles for heroin addicts like has been done in many states to curb HIV problems, but that is politically repugnant to Mike Pence. He also managed to get the Planned Parenthoods in that part of the state shut down, eliminating the opportunity for poor people to get tested. The HIV epidemic, which never had to be an epidemic, continues, and Pence gets to push the problem on our future governor as he goes to join Trump on the national stage.   * Speaking of Planned Parenthood, Pence is highly proud of his accomplishment at passing the single most restrictive abortion law since Roe vs Wade. The law, HEA 1337 is far stricter than anything even in the Deep South and is almost certainly unconstitutional. He knows that it's probably unconstitutional. Nevertheless, Indiana taxpayers will spend millions of dollars for our attorney general to fight the law all the way to the Supreme Court, just so Pence could make his political statement.   * He literally tried to make a state-run news agency that he would then give exclusive interviews and access to. I don't even know if that's legal, but he tried to do it and was promptly crucified by the media and even his own party.   * He asserted authority to ban Syrian refugees from being settled in Indiana. He has no authority. No governor has. He knew that, but he was planning to be a GOP presidential candidate, and he needed to show that he was strong and anti-Muslim refugee to appease the national GOP base. He took leadership role in this discriminatory crusade, appearing on national TV to preach his ignorance. This particular event managed to throw multiple refugee settlement organizations into disarray--which, by the way, actually include the Catholic Church of Indiana (the arch bishop of Indianapolis publicly criticized the governor)--and several Syrian refugees which were well into the process of moving to Indiana had to be relocated to another state. Pence didn't back down until the courts affirmed that his order was unconstitutional.  * He shut down a highly successful energy efficiency program--one of the first in the nation, making Indiana a trailblazer--initiated by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission with the support of previous governor Mitch Daniels. He did this for no good reason, other than to signal to his far-right constituents that he was fighting against Obama's evil despotic EPA.   This is all just in his three years in office. He is reviled across the state, and especially so in Indianapolis. There is (was--now that he's the VP nominee, he can no longer be governor) a bipartisan *Pence Must Go* campaign to get rid of him, and there are literally [billboards](http://media1.fdncms.com/nuvo/imager/u/original/3821872/pmg_billboard.jpg) and [yard signs](http://media.theindychannel.com/photo/2015/04/17/16x9/_Fire_Pence__signs_go_up_after_RFRA_2839710000_16967639_ver1.0_640_480.jpg) plastered all over the city. Pence is, by virtually all objective measures, one of the worst governors in recent Indiana history, at least in terms of working for the benefit of the state. He has basically focused on far-right Christian social conservative interests to the clear detriment of all else, most importantly the current and future well-being of the state's reputation and economy.
