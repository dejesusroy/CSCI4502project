Compare that to CSU, Long Beach (both of these schools give scholarships to National Merit Scholars) it costs aroun $7,000 to go there and the campus only has 32,000 students. There are many CSU campuses to choose from in California. \n\nUniversity of Arizona has around 42,000 students with tuition at $12,817 a year. University of California, Riverside tuition is $11,220 a year and there are 21,000 students there. \n\nThese costs don't factor financial aid, but I believe in California if families make less than $85,000 a year tuition to the UCs is free. We also have great financial aid for middle income students who attend CSUs and Community College. \n\nThe minimum wage in California is $10.50 and will be $15.00 by 2022. And that minimum wage is for everyone, including tipped positions.  I know a student who attends ASU and works at a chain restaurant. He transfers to a California location for that restaurant when he comes home for the summer. In Arizona he makes $5 an hour plus tips. In California he makes $10.50 plus tips. Doing the same job serving the same food. \n\nYou don't have to live near a city.

Then we visited a city one day and were on the subway and I saw these kids a lot younger than  mine getting off and on by themselves. I started giving my kids more and more freedoms when they got into junior high school and once they were in high school even more and by the time they could drive they had almost no rules. My kids never had a curfew; I just wanted to know where they were. It was made very clear that if they made the wrong choices those things would change. I had the luxury of living in a smallish and relatively safe city. \n\nThey loved their freedom so they didn't blow it. Now my kids are 18 and 20 and have traveled to many different countries without parents, and have taken numerous road trips in all different driving conditions. I was very unhappy about the ski trip in the snowstorm but everything worked out fine. When problems came up, they solved them. \n\nNot giving kids freedom to roam a neighborhood where they are at risk of real harm isn't bad parenting. There are plenty of opportunities where kids can grow and experience life.

Recently my time has been spent in underperforming Oakland charter schools. I have been a teacher, administrator, consultant, and parent volunteer. My kids attended public school and the youngest graduated from high school last year. \n\nI would suggest parents explore homeschool options for high school and take advantage of K-12 concurrent enrollment with junior college (In California) that allows students to take up to 11 units for $39 a semester. Usually the homeschool charter high schools will purchase the textbooks. There is no bigger waste of a high school student's time than an AP or IB class. \n\nI have watched elementary school change a lot over the last 15 years. The kindergarten my oldest child attended is not the same as the kindergarten at that school today. Time will tell if we see positive results from these changes but I would guess we won't. I've seen a lot of problems in schools over the years but they seem to be getting exponentially worse. And more money probably wouldn't solve them. In Oakland there is a desire to stop the \"pipeline to prison\" so suspensions are avoided. This sounds like a great idea until a 5th grader chokes the school psychologist and is back at school the next day. Or a 2nd grader takes his teacher's Macbook and throws it across the room because he was \"triggered.\" (No consideration is given to the other 19 kids in the class who might find that behavior disturbing) So his idiotic IEP includes all kinds of things that make it easier for the teacher and the class; but ensure that this kid will not be educated when he leaves the school in 5th grade. That particular child is in 4th grade now and he is expected to produce no work. Any day he doesn't run out of class is seen as great for him. \n\nI sat in a meeting this week where 4th grade teachers are going to divide the students and only teach one subject. This program is being piloted now with one teacher handling Language Arts and the other Math/Science. They have no data to support this move, but the teachers love it because it is \"easier.\" \n\nI used to believe that standardized testing was destroying public education. When my kids were in elementary school I opted them out. I still feel that it is harmful and the NCLB destroyed public education in the US. Unfortunately I also realize that if there isn't some kind of accountability, a large segment of our population will not be educated. There seems to be this constant kicking the can down the road and hoping for better later. So now the curriculum is pretty boring, there is very little enrichment, and teachers who aren't getting the job done are never, ever, EVER called out for it. Everyone pats each other on the back, hopes for better and just prays for the school year to end already.
