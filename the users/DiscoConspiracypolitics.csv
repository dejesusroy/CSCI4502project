Here is how I think this idea could evolve:  On the street because of a bad economy, and nothing to do with one's own lack of merits? Tough.  Not the government's problem.  Seek charity, or get a job that doesn't exist!  Near complete automation in our future? It doesn't matter.  Everyone will need to get a job that no longer exists.  We're in the here and the now and don't have to prepare an infrastructure to support the future.  And even if we did, it's against America's founding ideals to free load, even though the Founders might not have ever envisioned a world of automation.  In need of emergency medical care? Can't pay for it? Turn them away.  Life's tough and unfair.  It's just how it is.  Bootstraps! Could preventative care that the person could not afford have prevented the ER visit? Who cares.  Let them go bankrupt, until we take even that option away.  Debtor's prisons it is.  Don't want to bake a cake for an same-sex couple? That's fine.  But discriminate against a favored religion? Shut their business and lock them up!  Can't afford college or even trade school? No problem.  Stay poor, rise in ranks in a nonexistent job since they all require degrees, or take a gamble and start a business--if it fails, become even more poor! In this future, we just took away Limited Liability and other entities because there were too many deadbeat businesses.  Worried about getting pregnant? Contraceptives made illegal, by government no less? That's too bad.  Be married, moral, religious, abstain, and sleep in two separate beds.  Even Israel and probably even Russia take care of the citizens more than currently appears planned for our future.

That was a bit of an off topic tangent, but to answer your question directly:  Democrats can either make themselves a non-force on their own, or with Republican help through laws that suppress and restrict that party from ever being voted again where it matters.  See Voting ID and other laws, which some feel disproportionately affects Democrat voters (sometimes accidentally, sometimes intentionally).  Republicans could outright try to find terrorist ties, trumped up no doubt or with the most tenuous of connections, and declare the Democrat Party a terrorist organization.  I think this especially becomes a concern depending on who ends up heading the DNC.  We can also follow the example of Turkey under Erdogan and Russia under Putin.

They keep eachother in check, so when one starts to bully the citizens too much, the people always have a lesser evil.  Even here I'm concerned.  Between:  1) The voter ID stuff, which in theory is fine but in some states have been done in a way that disenfranchise people that vote Democrat  2) The things we've seen in NC  3) The vastly obstructionist approach of the GOP in Congress  4) People being indoctrinated to believe Democrats are basically the devil from a very young age (as I don't live in a Democrat-majority area, I'm not sure how much this is true on the other side) with talk radio to support it  5) Said indoctrination making people convinced that Democrats should not hold power ever nor pass their policy ideas, through all means necessary  6) Any other laws that could happen to favor Republicans in elections--such as permitting only land owners the vote again without adapting to our modern reality or providing a means for non land owners to have a say.  I wished I could be more hopeful.  I also think it's possible the Democrat Party will stupid its way into being labelled a terrorist organization by some sort of vague association, and Republicans might be more than willing to hand them the rope.  I hope an alternative to the Democrat party is already being worked on and will soon be ingrained into the system, in case the worse happens so Democrat voters can move to the alternative party and immediately be relevant again.  Even given the more likely scenario that Democrats will simply make themselves irrelevant since they may not really have leadership now.  I still see a One Party State in our future.  And I'm pretty it won't be, nor should it be, a Democrat one.  I'd like there to be more than just two relevant parties so power and choices is more distributed, but I have no idea how that can be done.","False","0","1","DiscoConspiracy","dclgp1m","False","t1_dclfxga","null","1484767855"
