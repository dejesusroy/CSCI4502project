It's definitely more edgy and has more fun with vulgarity and absurdity.  Parks and Rec is more character driven, and of course more of that Network TV feel.  If you like the Office more than Workaholics, then I'd say P&R.  If you like South Park more than Simpsons, probably try Sunny.    PErsonally, I like Parks.  The first season and a half weren't great, but once they brought in Adam Scott (and Rob Lowe), it got really good.  Plus it has Chris Pratt in his funny fat form.  ","False","0","2","Donald_J_Putin"

Both were heavy, had some real despair and moving moments, and a bittersweet ending.    Casey Affleck had an amazing performance of someone who was emotionally destroyed by his past.  He conveyed that guilt and resignation, regret, and wanting to punished.    Moonlight really shared some great performers among a bunch of actors (my favorite being the drug dealer in the first act, the guy from House of Cards and 4400 - that guy has really improved!).  But Afleck really heald a performance through all stages of his grief, which I give a bit more admiration to.    Both were great movies, but perhaps being a white catholic guy from the NE gave me a bit more of an ability to relate, versus a black gay male growing up in utter poverty.    Both were able to tackle some really heavy and depressing events/lives without feeling utterly depressed at the end.  It wasn't sad for the sake of pulling the audience to tears, but more to show the beauty and pain of guilt and shame.  I wouldn't be upset if either won best picture.  But I think Affleck has surpassed his brother as a lead, has more depth (and I still like Ben despite shit pop movies).  I really hope he gets the win.  For directing, its close, but Moonlight had more of a style to it that mixed pastel colors into the story in a way that was very immersive.    Good movie year - I just hope best picture doesn't go to Lala Land, which IMO was almost written to appeal to the Academy Awards by checking all the boxes that hollywood likes in a best picture.  It was good, but not great.  And personally, I left it not really having any of the songs stick with me.  the movie kinda peaks in the opening highway scene.","False","0","9","Donald_J_Putin"
